1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,640
Last time we saw things about gradients and
directional

2
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,030
derivatives. Before that we studied how to
look for minima and maxima of functions of

3
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,769
several variables.
And today we are going to look again at min/max

4
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,769
problems but in
a different setting, namely, one for variables

5
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:49,480
that
are not independent. And so what we will see

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,440
is you
may have heard of Lagrange multipliers.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,870
And this is the one point in the term when
I can shine with

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:08,420
my French accent and say Lagrange's name properly.
OK. What are Lagrange multipliers

9
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:19,660
1:about? Well, the goal is to minimize
or maximize a function of several variables.

10
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:35,349
Let's say, for example, f of x, y, z,
but where these variables are no longer independent.

11
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:43,690
They are not independent. That means that
there is a

12
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,220
relation between them. The relation is maybe
some

13
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,800
equation of the form g of x, y, z equals some
constant.

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,340
You take the relation between x, y, z, you
call that g and

15
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,950
that gives you the constraint. And your goal
is to minimize f

16
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,989
only of those values of x, y, z that satisfy
the

17
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:09,690
constraint. What is one way to do that?
Well, one to do that, if the constraint is

18
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,410
very
simple, we can maybe solve for one of the

19
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,660
variables.
Maybe we can solve this equation for one of

20
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,730
the
variables, plug it back into f, and then we

21
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,810
have a usual
min/max problem that we have seen how to do.

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,720
The problem is sometimes you cannot actually
solve for x,

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,349
y, z in here because this condition is too
complicated and

24
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:37,510
then we need a new method. That is what we
are going to do.

25
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,740
Why would we care about that? Well, one example
is actually

26
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,100
in physics. Maybe you have seen in
thermodynamics that you study quantities about

27
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,750
gases,
and those quantities that involve pressure,

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,890
volume and temperature. And pressure,
volume and temperature are not independent

29
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,060
of each other.
I mean you know probably the equation PV = NRT.

30
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,960
And, of course, there you could actually solve
to express things in terms of one or the other.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,430
But sometimes it is more convenient to keep
all three

32
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,490
variables but treat them as constrained.
It is just an example of a situation where

33
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:22,390
you might want
to do this. Anyway, we will look mostly at

34
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,850
particular examples, but just to point out
that this

35
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:33,510
is useful when you study guesses in physics.
The first observation is we cannot use our

36
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,720
usual method of
looking for critical points of f.

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,310
Because critical points of f typically will
not satisfy this

38
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:49,310
condition and so won't be good solutions.
We need something else. Let's look at an example,

39
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,150
and we will see how that leads us to the method.
For example, let's say that I want to find

40
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:08,490
the point closest to the origin -- -- 

41
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:22,930
on the hyperbola xy equals
3 in the plane. That means I have this

42
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,740
hyperbola, and I am asking myself what is
the point on it

43
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,069
that is the closest to the origin?
I mean we can solve this by elementary geometry,

44
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:36,319
we don't need actually Lagrange multipliers,
but we are going to do it with Lagrange multipliers

45
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,099
because it
is a pretty good example. What does it mean?

46
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:47,379
Well, it means that we want to minimize distance
to the origin.

47
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:52,360
What is the distance to the origin?
If I have a point, at coordinates (x,

48
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,830
y) and then the distance to the origin is
square root of x

49
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,289
squared plus y squared. Well, do we really
want to

50
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:04,150
minimize that or can we minimize something
easier?

51
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,840
Yeah. Maybe we can minimize the
square of a distance. Let's forget this guy

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:22,639
and
instead -- Actually, we will minimize f of

53
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,719
x,
y equals x squared plus y squared,

54
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:35,729
that looks better, subject to the constraint
xy =

55
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:50,629
3. And so we will call this thing
g of x, y to illustrate the general method.

56
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:58,559
Let's look at a picture. Here you can see
in yellow the

57
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,669
hyperbola xy equals three. And we are going
to look for

58
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:06,800
the points that are the closest to the origin.
What can we do? Well, for example,

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,860
6:we can plot the function x squared plus
y squared,

60
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:20,789
function f. That is the contour plot of f
with a hyperbola on top of it. Now let's see

61
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:25,360
what we can do
with that. Well, let's ask ourselves,

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,919
for example, if I look at points where f
equals 20 now. I think I am at 20 but you

63
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,110
cannot really see it. That is a circle with
a point

64
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,189
whose distant square is 20. Well, can I find
a solution if

65
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,869
I am on the hyperbola? Yes, there are four
points at

66
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:48,520
this distance. Can I do better?
Well, let's decrease for distance.

67
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,619
Yes, we can still find points on the hyperbola
and so on.

68
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,710
Except if we go too low then there are no
points on this

69
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,400
circle anymore in the hyperbola. If we decrease
the value of f

70
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,219
that we want to look at that will somehow
limit value beyond

71
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,389
which we cannot go, and that is the minimum
of f.

72
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,999
We are trying to look for the smallest value
of f that will

73
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:19,469
actually be realized on the hyperbola.
When does that happen? Well, I have to backtrack

74
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,899
a
little bit. It seems like the limiting case

75
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:29,210
is basically here. It is when the circle is
tangent to the hyperbola. That is the smallest

76
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:36,240
circle
that will hit the hyperbola. If I take a larger

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,649
value of f,
I will have solutions. If I take a smaller

78
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,270
value of f,
I will not have any solutions anymore.

79
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:49,289
So, that is the situation that we want to
solve for.

80
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,860
How do we find that minimum? Well, a key observation
that is

81
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,279
valid on this picture, and that actually remain
true

82
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,319
in the completely general case, is that when
we have a minimum

83
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,939
the level curve of f is actually tangent to
our hyperbola.

84
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:20,830
It is tangent to the set of points where x,
y equals three, to the hyperbola.

85
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:31,960
Let's write that down. We observe that at
the minimum

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:51,980
the level curve of f is tangent to the hyperbola.
Remember, the hyperbola is given by the equal

87
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,130
g equals
three, so it is a level curve of g.

88
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,720
We have a level curve of f and a level curve
of g that are

89
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,899
tangent to each other. And I claim that is
going to be

90
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:07,180
the general situation that we are interested
in.

91
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:21,290
How do we try to solve for points where this
happens?

92
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:29,880
How do we find x, y where the level curves
of f

93
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:47,620
and g are tangent to each other? Let's think
for a second.

94
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,500
If the two level curves are tangent to each
other that means

95
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,540
they have the same tangent line. That means
that the normal

96
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,060
vectors should be parallel. Let me maybe draw
a picture

97
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:12,519
here. This is the level curve maybe f
equals something. And this is the level curve

98
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,459
g
equals constant. Here my constant is three.

99
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,740
Well, if I look for gradient vectors, the
gradient of f will

100
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,230
be perpendicular to the level curve of f.
The gradient of g will be perpendicular to

101
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,990
the level curve
of g. They don't have any reason to

102
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,620
be of the same size, but they have to be parallel
to

103
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,490
each other. Of course, they could also be
parallel pointing in opposite directions.

104
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:49,730
But the key point is that when this happens
the gradient of f

105
00:10:49,730 --> 00:11:03,279
is parallel to the gradient of g.
Well, let's check that. Here is a point.

106
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,550
And I can plot the gradient of f in blue.
The gradient of g in yellow. And you see,

107
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,480
11:in most of these places, somehow the two
gradients are

108
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,500
not really parallel. Actually, I should not
be

109
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,800
looking at random points. I should be looking
only on the

110
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,310
hyperbola. I want points on the hyperbola
where the two gradients are parallel.

111
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,639
Well, when does that happen? Well, it looks
like it will

112
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:33,100
happen here. When I am at a minimum,
the two gradient vectors are parallel.

113
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,819
It is not really proof. It is an example that
seems to

114
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:45,699
be convincing. So far things work pretty well.
How do we decide if two vectors are parallel?

115
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:48,949
Well, they are parallel when they are proportional
to each

116
00:11:48,949 --> 00:12:02,490
other. You can write one of them as a
constant times the other one, and that constant

117
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,899
usually one
uses the Greek letter lambda. I don't know

118
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,910
if you have seen
it before. It is the Greek letter for L.

119
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,220
And probably, I am sure, it is somebody's
idea of paying tribute to Lagrange by putting

120
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:25,689
an L in
there. Lambda is just a constant.

121
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:30,790
And we are looking for a scalar lambda and
points x and y where

122
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,319
this holds. In fact,
what we are doing is replacing min/max problems

123
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,920
in two
variables with a constraint between them by

124
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,290
a set of
equations involving, you will see, three variables.

125
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:59,629
We had min/max with two variables x, y,
but no independent. We had a constraint g

126
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:05,769
of x,
y equals constant. And that becomes something

127
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:15,120
new.
That becomes a system of equations 
where we have to

128
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,699
solve, well, let's write down what it means
for gradient f to

129
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,889
be proportional to gradient g. That means
that f sub x should

130
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,790
be lambda times g sub x, and f sub y should
be lambda

131
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:39,170
times g sub y. Because the gradient vectors
here are f sub x, f sub y and g sub x,

132
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:45,750
g sub y. If you have a third variable z
then you have also an equation f sub z equals

133
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:52,449
lambda g sub z.
Now, let's see. How many unknowns do we have

134
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,120
in
these equations? Well, there is x,

135
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:01,810
there is y and there is lambda. We have three
unknowns and have

136
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:09,509
only two equations. Something is missing.
Well, I mean x and y are not actually independent.

137
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:20,040
They are related by the equation g of x,
y equals c, so we need to add the constraint

138
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,990
g equals c.
And now we have three equations involving

139
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:36,269
three variables.
Let's see how that works. Here remember we

140
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:44,009
have f equals
x squared y squared and g = xy. What is f

141
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:50,529
sub x?
It is going to be 2x equals lambda times,

142
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:58,319
what is g sub x, y.
Maybe I should write here f sub x equals lambda

143
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:04,370
g sub x just to
remind you. Then we have f sub y equals

144
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:16,430
lambda g sub y. F sub y is 2y equals lambda
times g sub y is x. And then our third equation

145
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,579
g
equals c becomes xy equals three.

146
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:37,499
So, that is what you would have to solve.
Any questions at this point? No.

147
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:45,769
Yes? How do I know the direction of
a gradient? Do you mean how do I know that

148
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:53,370
it is perpendicular to a level curve?
Oh, how do I know if it points in that direction

149
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,379
on the
opposite one? Well, that depends.

150
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,360
I mean we'd seen in last time, but the gradient
is

151
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,620
perpendicular to the level and points towards
higher values of

152
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,050
a function. So it could be -- Wait.
What did I have? It could be that my gradient

153
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,610
16:vectors up there actually point in opposite
directions.

154
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,999
It doesn't matter to me because it will still
look the same in

155
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,649
terms of the equation, just lambda will be
positive or

156
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:22,800
negative, depending on the case. I can handle
both situations.

157
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,889
It's not a problem. I can allow lambda to
be

158
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:35,189
positive or negative. Well, in this example,
it looks like lambda will be positive.

159
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:47,920
If you look at the picture on the plot.
Yes? Well, because actually they are

160
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,839
not equal to each other. If you look at this
point where

161
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,629
the hyperbola and the circle touch each other,
first of all, I don't know which circle I

162
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:01,430
am
going to look at. I am trying to solve,

163
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,490
actually, for the radius of the circle.
I am trying to find what the minimum value

164
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,010
of f is.
And, second, at that point,

165
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,309
the value of f and the value of g are not
equal.

166
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,189
g is equal to three because I want the hyperbola
x equals

167
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,610
three. The value of f will be the
square of a distance, whatever that is.

168
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,329
I think it will end up being 6, but we will
see.

169
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,660
So, you cannot really set them equal because
you don't know

170
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:49,840
what f is equal to in advance. Yes?
Not quite. Actually, here I am just using

171
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,670
this idea of finding a point closest to the
origin to

172
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,040
illustrate an example of a min/max problem.
The general problem we are trying to solve

173
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,220
is minimize f
subject to g equals constant. And what we

174
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,530
are going to do for
that is we are really going to say instead

175
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,390
let's look at places
where gradient f and gradient g are parallel

176
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,440
to each other and
solve for equations of that. I think we completely

177
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,160
lose the
notion of closest point if we just look at

178
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,830
these equations.
We don't really say anything about closest

179
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,600
points anymore.
Of course, that is what they mean in the end.

180
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,910
But, in the general setting, there is no closest
point

181
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:40,750
involved anymore. OK.
Yes? Yes.

182
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:46,540
It is always going to be the case that,
at the minimum, or at the maximum of a function

183
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,750
subject to a constraint, the level curves
of f and the

184
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,970
level curves of g will be tangent to each
other.

185
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,400
That is the basis for this method.
I am going to justify that soon. It could

186
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,650
be minimum or maximum.
In three-dimensions it could even be a saddle

187
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,860
point.
And, in fact, I should say in advance,

188
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,520
this method will not tell us whether it is
a minimum or a

189
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,880
maximum. We do not have any way of
19:knowing, except for testing values.

190
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,490
We cannot use second derivative tests or anything
like that.

191
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:22,550
I will get back to that. Yes?
Yes. Here you can set y equals to

192
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:29,420
favor x. Then you can minimize x squared
plus nine over x squared. In general, if I

193
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,960
am trying to
solve a more complicated problem, I might

194
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,680
not be able to
solve. I am doing an example where,

195
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,470
indeed, here you could solve and remove one
variable,

196
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,290
but you cannot always do that. And this method
will still work.

197
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:52,340
The other one won't. OK.
I don't see any other questions. Are there

198
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,860
any other questions?
No. OK.

199
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,780
I see a lot of students stretching and so
on,

200
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:08,540
so it is very confusing for me. How do we
solve these equations?

201
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,120
20:Well, the answer is in general we might
be in deep trouble.

202
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,570
There is no general method for solving the
equations that you

203
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,530
get from this method. You just have to think
about

204
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:27,340
them. Sometimes it will be very easy.
Sometimes it will be so hard that you cannot

205
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,210
actually do it
without the computer. Sometimes it will be

206
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,630
just hard
enough to be on Part B of this week's problem

207
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:53,910
set.
I claim in this case we can actually do it

208
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:00,520
without so much
trouble, because actually we can think of

209
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:09,390
this as a two by two
linear system in x and y. Well, let me do

210
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,260
something.
Let me rewrite the first two equations as

211
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:30,290
2x - lambda y = 0.
And lambda x - 2y = 0. And xy = 3.

212
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,990
That is what we want to solve. Well, I can
put this into

213
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:46,940
matrix form. Two minus lambda,
lambda minus two times x, y equals 0,0.

214
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,730
Now, how do I solve a linear system matrix
times x,

215
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,730
y equals zero? Well, I always have an obvious
solution. X and y both equal to zero.

216
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,080
Is that a good solution? No, because zero
times zero is

217
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:17,640
not three. We want another solution,
the trivial solution. 0,0 does not solve the

218
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,790
constraint equation xy equals three, so we
want another

219
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,360
solution. When do we have another
solution? Well, when the determinant of a

220
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:46,090
matrix is zero. We have other solutions that
exist only if determinant of a matrix is zero.

221
00:22:46,090 --> 00:23:05,130
M is this guy. Let's compute the determinant.
Well, that seems to be negative four plus

222
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,470
lambda squared.
23:That is zero exactly when lambda squared

223
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:20,570
equals four,
which is lambda is plus or minus two.

224
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,790
Already you see here it is a the level of
difficulty that is

225
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,740
a little bit much for an exam but perfectly
fine for a problem

226
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:35,950
set or for a beautiful lecture like this one.
How do we deal with -- Well, we have two cases

227
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,810
to look at.
Lambda equals two or lambda equals minus two.

228
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,890
Let's start with lambda equals two.
If I set lambda equals two, what does this

229
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,000
equation become?
Well, it becomes x equals y. This one becomes

230
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,990
y equals x.
Well, they seem to be the same. x equals y.

231
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:06,740
And then the equation xy equals three becomes,
well, x squared equals three. I have two solutions.

232
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,480
One is x equals root three and, therefore,
y equals root three

233
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:23,040
as well, or negative root three and negative
root three.

234
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,060
Let's look at the other case. If I set lambda
equal to

235
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,710
negative two then I get 2x equals negative
2y.

236
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,800
That means x equals negative y. The second
one,

237
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,640
2y equals negative 2x. That is y equals negative
x.

238
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,040
Well, that is the same thing. And xy equals
three becomes

239
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,390
negative x squared equals three. Can we solve
that?

240
00:24:51,390 --> 00:25:01,360
No. There are no solutions here.
Now we have two candidate points which are

241
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,320
these two
points, root three, root three or negative

242
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:13,650
root
three, negative root three. OK.

243
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,380
Let's actually look at what we have here.
Maybe you cannot read the coordinates, but

244
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,750
the point that
I have here is indeed root three, root three.

245
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,440
How do we see that lambda equals two?
Well, if you look at this picture, the gradient

246
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,970
of f,
that is the blue vector, is indeed twice the

247
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,750
yellow
vector, gradient g. That is where you read

248
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,370
the
value of lambda. And we have the other solution

249
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:48,930
which is somewhere here. Negative root three,
negative root there. And there, again,

250
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:59,580
lambda equals two. The two vectors are
proportional by a factor of two. Yes?

251
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,400
No, solutions are not quite guaranteed to
be absolute minima

252
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,460
or maxima. They are guaranteed to be
somehow critical points end of a constraint.

253
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,840
That means if you were able to solve and eliminate
the variable

254
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,860
that would be a critical point. When you have
the same problem,

255
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,420
as we have critical points, are they maxima
or minima?

256
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,760
And the answer is, well, we won't know until
we

257
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:32,670
check. More questions?
No. Yes?

258
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,210
What is a Lagrange multiplier? Well, it is
this number lambda

259
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,440
that is called the multiplier here.
It is a multiplier because it is what you

260
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:50,550
have to multiply
gradient of g by to get gradient of f.

261
00:26:50,550 --> 00:27:09,770
It multiplies.
Let's try to see why is this method valid?

262
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:19,760
Because so far I have shown you pictures and
have said see they

263
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,460
are tangent. But why is it that they have
to

264
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:36,020
be tangent in general? Let's think about it.
Let's say that we are at constrained min or

265
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,700
max.
What that means is that if I move on the level

266
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,060
g equals
constant then the value of f should only increase

267
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,860
or only
decrease. But it means,

268
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:56,420
in particular, to first order it will not
change. At an unconstrained min or max,

269
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,220
partial derivatives are zero. In this case,
derivatives are zero only in the allowed directions.

270
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,970
And the allowed directions are those that
stay on the levels of

271
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:21,800
this g equals constant. In any direction along
the

272
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:40,470
level set g = c the rate of change of f must
be zero.

273
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,890
That is what happens at minima or maxima.
Except here, of course, we look only at the

274
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:54,510
allowed directions. Let's say the same thing
in

275
00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:35,440
terms of directional derivatives.
That means for any direction that is tangent

276
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:44,940
to the
constraint level g equal c, we must have df

277
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:58,710
over ds in the
direction of u equals zero. I will draw a

278
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,400
picture.
Let's say now I am in three variables just

279
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:08,270
to give you
different examples. Here I have a level surface

280
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,740
g
equals c. I am at my point.

281
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,910
And if I move in any direction that is on
the level surface,

282
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,920
so I move in the direction u tangent to the
level surface,

283
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,540
then the rate of change of f in that direction
should be zero.

284
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,380
Now, remember what the formula is for this
guy.

285
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:43,710
Well, we have seen that this guy is actually
radiant f dot u.

286
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,610
That means any such vector u must be perpendicular
to the

287
00:30:48,610 --> 00:31:04,960
gradient of f. That means that the gradient
of

288
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,950
f should be perpendicular to anything that
is tangent to this

289
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,050
level. That means the gradient of f
should be perpendicular to the level set.

290
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:39,490
That is what we have shown.
But we know another vector that is also perpendicular

291
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:56,900
to the
level set of g. That is the gradient of g.

292
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,480
We conclude that the gradient of f must be
parallel to the

293
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,600
gradient of g because both are perpendicular
to the level set

294
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,330
of g. I see confused faces,
so let me try to tell you again where that

295
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,080
comes from.
We said if we had a constrained minimum or

296
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,140
maximum,
if we move in the level set of g, f doesn't

297
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,450
change.
Well, it doesn't change to first order.

298
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,880
It is the same idea as when you are looking
for a minimum you

299
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,770
set the derivative equal to zero.
So the derivative in any direction, tangent

300
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,120
to g equals
c, should be the directional derivative of

301
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,070
f,
in any such direction, should be zero.

302
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,410
That is what we mean by critical point of
f.

303
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:49,730
And so that means that any vector u, any unit
vector

304
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:55,350
tangent to the level set of g is going to
be perpendicular to the

305
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,540
gradient of f. That means that the gradient
of

306
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:05,940
f is perpendicular to the level set of g.
If you want, that means the level sets of

307
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,510
f
and g are tangent to each other. That is justifying

308
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,020
what we have
observed in the picture that the two level

309
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,960
sets have to be
tangent to each other at the prime minimum

310
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,660
or maximum.
Does that make a little bit of sense?

311
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:33,360
Kind of. I see at least a few faces
nodding so I take that to be a positive answer.

312
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:44,750
Since I have been asked by several of you,
how do I know if it is a maximum or a minimum?

313
00:33:44,750 --> 00:34:09,129
Well, warning, the method doesn't tell whether
a solution 
is a minimum or a maximum.

314
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:26,520
How do we do it? Well, more bad news.
We cannot use the second derivative test.

315
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,099
And the reason for that is that we care actually
only about

316
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:34,280
these specific directions that are tangent
to variable of g.

317
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,000
And we don't want to bother to try to define
directional second

318
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,629
derivatives. Not to mention that actually
it

319
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,970
wouldn't work. There is a criterion but it
is

320
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,639
much more complicated than that. Basically,
the answer for us is

321
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,100
that we don't have a second derivative test
in this

322
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,010
situation. What are we left with?
Well, we are just left with comparing values.

323
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,630
Say that in this problem you found a point
where f equals

324
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,660
three, a point where f equals nine, a point
where f equals 15.

325
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,750
Well, then probably the minimum is the point
where f equals

326
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,160
35:three and the maximum is 15. Actually,
in this case,

327
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,630
where we found minima, these two points are
tied for

328
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,930
minimum. What about the maximum?
What is the maximum of f on the hyperbola?

329
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,020
Well, it is infinity because the point can
go as far as you

330
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:31,640
want from the origin. But the general idea
is if we

331
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,830
have a good reason to believe that there should
be a minimum,

332
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,950
and it's not like at infinity or something
weird like that,

333
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,210
then the minimum will be a solution of the
Lagrange

334
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,480
multiplier equations. We just look for all
the

335
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,990
solutions and then we choose the one that
gives us the lowest

336
00:35:46,990 --> 00:36:23,510
value. Is that good enough?
Let me actually write that down.

337
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:36,710
To find the minimum or the maximum, we compare
values of f

338
00:36:36,710 --> 00:37:03,130
at the various solutions -- -- 
to Lagrange multiplier
equations.

339
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:11,350
37:I should say also that sometimes you can
just conclude

340
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,630
by thinking geometrically. In this case,
when it is asking you which point is closest

341
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:22,290
to the origin
you can just see that your answer is the correct

342
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:30,700
one.
Let's do an advanced example. Advanced means

343
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:36,330
that -- Well,
this one I didn't actually dare to put on

344
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:47,900
top of the other
problem sets. Instead, I am going to do it.

345
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,390
What is this going to be about? We are going
to look for a

346
00:37:50,390 --> 00:38:01,250
surface minimizing pyramid. Let's say that
we want to build

347
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:16,840
a pyramid with a given triangular base -- -- and
a

348
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:28,880
given volume. Say that I have maybe in the
x,

349
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,800
y plane I am giving you some triangle.
And I am going to try to build a pyramid.

350
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:48,040
Of course, I can choose where to put the top
of a pyramid.

351
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:59,980
This guy will end up being behind now.
And the constraint and the goal is to minimize

352
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:12,420
the total surface
area. The first time I taught this

353
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,970
class, it was a few years ago, was just before
they built the

354
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,460
Stata Center. And then I used to motivate
this problem by saying Frank Gehry has gone

355
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,310
crazy and has
been given a triangular plot of land he wants

356
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,070
to put a pyramid.
There needs to be the right amount of volume

357
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,720
so that you can
put all the offices in there. And he wants

358
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,210
it to be,
actually, covered in solid gold.

359
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,420
And because that is expensive, the administration
wants him to

360
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,340
cut the costs a bit. And so you have to minimize
the

361
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,790
total size so that it doesn't cost too much.
We will see if MIT comes up with a triangular

362
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,310
pyramid
building. Hopefully not.

363
00:39:47,310 --> 00:40:01,880
It could be our next dorm, you never know.
Anyway, it is a fine geometry problem.

364
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:09,760
Let's try to think about how we can do this.
The natural way to think about it would be

365
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,770
-- Well,
what do we have to look for first?

366
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:17,250
We have to look for the position of that top
point.

367
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:24,290
Remember we know that the volume of a pyramid
is one-third

368
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:37,300
the area of base times height. In fact, fixing
the volume,

369
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,040
knowing that we have fixed the area of a base,
means that we are fixing the height of the

370
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,500
pyramid.
The height is completely fixed. What we have

371
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,000
to choose just is
where do we put that top point? Do we put

372
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,470
it smack in the
middle of a triangle or to a side or even

373
00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:12,780
anywhere we want?
Its z coordinate is fixed. Let's call h the

374
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:20,720
height.
What we could do is something like this.

375
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:31,040
We say we have three points of a base.
Let's call them p1 at (x1, y1,0); p2 at (x2,

376
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:40,080
y2,0); p3 at (x3, y3,0).
This point p is the unknown point at (x, y,

377
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,110
h). We know the height.
And then we want to minimize the sum of the

378
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,170
areas of these
three triangles. One here, one here and one

379
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,060
at
the back. And areas of triangles we know

380
00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:00,110
how to express by using length of cross-product.
It becomes a function of x and y.

381
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,810
And you can try to minimize it. Actually,
it doesn't quite work.

382
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:12,280
The formulas are just too complicated.
You will never get there. What happens is

383
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,970
actually maybe
we need better coordinates. Why do we need

384
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,590
better
coordinates? That is because the geometry

385
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,450
is
kind of difficult to do if you use x, y coordinates.

386
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,520
I mean formula for cross-product is fine,
but then the length of the vector will be

387
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:37,010
annoying and just
doesn't look good. Instead, let's think about

388
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:54,490
it
differently.

389
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:59,460
I claim if we do it this way and we express
the area as a

390
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:10,060
function of x, y, well, actually we can't
solve for a minimum. Here is another way to

391
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:15,230
do it.
Well, what has worked pretty well for us so

392
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,890
far is this
geometric idea of base times height.

393
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:26,130
So let's think in terms of the heights of
side triangles.

394
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:42,960
I am going to use the height of these things.
And I am going to say that the area will be

395
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,380
the sum of three
terms, which are three bases times three heights.

396
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,590
Let's give names to these quantities.
Actually, for that it is going to be good

397
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:01,090
to have the point in
the xy plane that lives directly below p.

398
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:10,470
Let's call it q. P is the point that coordinates
44:x, y, h. And let's call q the point that

399
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:20,119
is just below it and so it' coordinates are
x,

400
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:31,420
y, 0. Let's see.
Let me draw a map of this thing. p1, p2, p3

401
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:37,780
and I have my point
q in the middle. Let's see.

402
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:44,180
To know these areas, I need to know the base.
Well, the base I can decide that I know it

403
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,610
because it is
part of my given data. I know the sides of

404
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,820
this
triangle. Let me call the lengths a1,

405
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:58,640
a2, a3. I also need to know the height,
so I need to know these lengths.

406
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,000
How do I know these lengths? Well, its distance
in space,

407
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,080
but it is a little bit annoying.
But maybe I can reduce it to a distance in

408
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:14,470
the plane by looking
instead at this distance here. Let me give

409
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:21,800
names to the
distances from q to the sides. Let's call

410
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:40,900
u1,
u2, u3 the distances from q to the sides.

411
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:53,119
Well, now I can claim I can find, actually,
sorry. I need to draw one more thing.

412
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,500
I claim I have a nice formula for the area,
because this is vertical and this is horizontal

413
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,400
so this
length here is u3, this length here is h.

414
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:14,150
So what is this length here? It is the square
root of u3

415
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,660
squared plus h squared. And similarly for
these other

416
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:30,210
guys. They are square roots of a u
squared plus h squared. The heights of the

417
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:36,820
faces are
square root of u1 squared times h squared.

418
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:43,740
And similarly with u2 and u3. So the total
side area is going

419
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:55,540
to be the area of the first faces,
one-half of base times height, plus one-half

420
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:05,210
of a base times a
height plus one-half of the third one.

421
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,970
It doesn't look so much better. But, trust
me,

422
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:15,480
it will get better. Now, that is a function
of

423
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:22,270
three variables, u1, u2, u3.
And how do we relate u1, u2, u3 to each other?

424
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:27,460
They are probably not independent.
Well, let's cut this triangle here into three

425
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:38,720
pieces like
that. Then each piece has side --

426
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:47,800
Well, let's look at it the piece of the bottom.
It has base a3, height u3. Cutting base into

427
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:57,359
three tells
you that the area of a base is one-half of

428
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,230
a1,
u1 plus one-half of a2, u2 plus one-half of

429
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:08,230
a3,
u3. And that is our constraint.

430
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,240
My three variables, u1, u2, u3, are constrained
in

431
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,619
this way. The sum of this figure must be
the area of a base. And I want to minimize

432
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,720
that guy.
So that is my g and that guy here is my f.

433
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,390
Now we try to apply our Lagrange multiplier
equations.

434
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:35,260
Well, partial f of a partial u1 is -- Well,
if you do the calculation, you will see it

435
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:42,830
is one-half a1,
u1 over square root of u1^2 plus h^2 equals

436
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,330
lambda,
what is partial g, partial a1?

437
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:49,330
That one you can do, I am sure. It is one-half
a1.

438
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:58,480
Oh, these guys simplify. If you do the same
with the

439
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:17,220
second one -- -- 
things simplify again.
And the same with the third one. Well, you

440
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,510
will get,
after simplifying, u3 over square root of

441
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,500
u3
squared plus h squared equals lambda.

442
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,080
Now, that means this guy equals this guy equals
this guy.

443
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,350
They are all equal to lambda. And, if you
think about it,

444
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:38,140
that means that u1 = u2 = u3. See, it looked
like scary

445
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,260
equations but the solution is very simple.
What does it mean? It means that our point

446
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,050
q
should be equidistant from all three sides.

447
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,430
That is called the incenter. Q should be in
the incenter.

448
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,940
The next time you have to build a golden pyramid
and don't want

449
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,270
to go broke, well, you know where to put the
top.

450
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,440
If that was a bit fast, sorry. Anyway, it
is not completely

451
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,010
crucial. But go over it and you will see
it works. Have a nice weekend.

452
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:08,180
50:
