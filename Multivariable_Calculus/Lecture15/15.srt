6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:25,159
Let me start by basically listing the main
things we have

7
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:30,199
learned over the past three weeks or so.
And I will add a few complements of information

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,430
about
that because there are a few small details

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,640
that I didn't
quite clarify and that I should probably make

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,440
a bit clearer,
especially what happened at the very end of

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:53,109
yesterday's class.
Here is a list of things that should be on

12
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:58,929
your review sheet
for the exam. The first thing we learned

13
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:03,280
about, the main topic of this unit is about
functions of

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:11,909
several variables. We have learned how to
think of

15
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,020
functions of two or three variables in terms
of plotting

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,950
them. In particular,
well, not only the graph but also the contour

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:29,240
plot and how to
read a contour plot. And we have learned how

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,299
to
study variations of these functions using

19
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:43,670
partial
derivatives. Remember, we have defined the

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,750
partial of f with respect to some variable,
say, x to be the rate of change with respect

21
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,479
to x when we hold
all the other variables constant.

22
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,170
If you have a function of x and y, this symbol
means you

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:07,280
differentiate with respect to x treating y
as a constant.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:16,730
And we have learned how to package partial
derivatives into

25
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,530
a vector,the gradient vector. For example,
if we have a function of three variables,

26
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,769
the vector whose
components are the partial derivatives.

27
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,340
And we have seen how to use the gradient vector
or the partial

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,390
derivatives to derive various things such
as approximation

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:45,170
formulas. The change in f,
when we change x, y, z slightly,

30
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:57,920
is approximately equal to, well, there are
several terms.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,239
And I can rewrite this in vector form as the
gradient dot

32
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,720
product the amount by which the position vector
has changed.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,610
Basically, what causes f to change is that
I am changing x,

34
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,629
y and z by small amounts and how sensitive
f is to each

35
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,129
variable is precisely what the partial derivatives
measure.

36
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:26,849
And, in particular, this approximation is
called

37
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,090
the tangent plane approximation because it
tells us,

38
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,700
in fact, it amounts to identifying the
graph of the function with its tangent plane.

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,840
It means that we assume that the function
depends more or

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,010
less linearly on x, y and z.
And, if we set these things equal, what we

41
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,930
get is actually,
we are replacing the function by its linear

42
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,659
approximation.
We are replacing the graph by its tangent

43
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,409
plane.
Except, of course, we haven't see the graph

44
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,200
of a
function of three variables because that would

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
live in
4-dimensional space. So, when we think of

46
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
a graph,
really, it is a function of two variables.

47
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,900
That also tells us how to find tangent planes
to level

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:30,820
surfaces.
Recall that the tangent plane to a surface,

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,190
given by the equation f of x, y, z equals
z,

50
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,040
at a given point can be found by looking first
for its normal

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,130
vector. And we know that the normal
vector is actually, well,

52
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,730
one normal vector is given by the gradient
of a function

53
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,690
because we know that the gradient is actually
pointing

54
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,480
perpendicularly to the level sets towards
higher values of a

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,310
function. And it gives us the direction
of fastest increase of a function.

56
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:16,570
OK. Any questions about these
topics? No.

57
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,800
OK. Let me add, actually,
a cultural note to what we have seen so far

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,780
about partial
derivatives and how to use them, which is

59
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,120
maybe something I
should have mentioned a couple of weeks ago.

60
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,620
Why do we like partial derivatives?
Well, one obvious reason is we can do all

61
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,910
these things.
But another reason is that, really,

62
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,500
you need partial derivatives to do physics
and to understand

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,220
much of the world that is around you because
a lot of things

64
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:55,110
actually are governed by what is called partial
differentiation

65
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:04,730
equations.
So if you want a cultural remark about what

66
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,520
this is good
for. A partial differential equation

67
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,590
is an equation that involves the partial derivatives
of a

68
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,320
function. So you have some function that
is unknown that depends on a bunch of variables.

69
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,490
And a partial differential equation is some
relation

70
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:35,770
between its partial derivatives. Let me see.
These are equations involving the partial

71
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:54,000
derivatives -- -- 
of
an unknown function. Let me give you an example

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,730
to
see how that works. For example,

73
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:06,060
the heat equation is one example of a partial
differential equation. It is the equation

74
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,080
-- Well,
let me write for you the space version of

75
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,090
it.
It is the equation partial f over partial

76
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,470
t equals some
constant times the sum of the second partials

77
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:31,320
with respect to
x, y and z. So this is an equation where we

78
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,750
are trying to solve for a function f that
depends,

79
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:46,780
actually, on four variables, x, y, z, t.
And what should you have in mind?

80
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,470
Well, this equation governs temperature.
If you think that f of x, y, z, t will be

81
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,290
the temperature at a
point in space at position x, y, z and at

82
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,170
time t,
then this tells you how temperature changes

83
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,970
over time.
It tells you that at any given point,

84
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,870
the rate of change of temperature over time
is given

85
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,520
by this complicated expression in the partial
derivatives in

86
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,340
terms of the space coordinates x, y, z.
If you know, for example, the initial distribution

87
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,610
of
temperature in this room, and if you assume

88
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,310
that nothing
is generating heat or taking heat away,

89
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,490
so if you don't have any air conditioning
or heating going

90
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,890
on, then it will tell you how the
temperature will change over time and eventually

91
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:41,120
stabilize to
some final value. Yes?

92
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,110
Why do we take the partial derivative twice?
Well, that is a question, I would say,

93
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,620
for a physics person. But in a few weeks we
will

94
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,780
actually see a derivation of where this equation
comes from

95
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,370
and try to justify it. But, really,
that is something you will see in a physics

96
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,620
class.
The reason for that is basically physics of

97
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,700
how heat is
transported between particles in fluid, or

98
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,280
actually any medium.
This constant k actually is called the heat

99
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,180
conductivity.
It tells you how well the heat flows through

100
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,110
the material that
you are looking at. Anyway, I am giving it

101
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,370
to you
just to show you an example of a real life

102
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,130
problem where,
in fact, you have to solve one of these things.

103
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,440
Now, how to solve partial differential equations
is not a

104
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,970
topic for this class. It is not even a topic
for

105
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,750
18.03 which is called Differential Equations,
without partial, which means there actually

106
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,590
you
will learn tools to study and solve these

107
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,450
equations but when
there is only one variable involved.

108
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,200
And you will see it is already quite hard.
And, if you want more on that one, we have

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,210
many fine classes
about partial differential equations.

110
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,120
But one thing at a time. I wanted to point
out to you

111
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,760
that very often functions that you see in
real life satisfy

112
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,870
many nice relations between the partial derivatives.
That was in case you were wondering why on

113
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,870
the syllabus
for today it said partial differential equations.

114
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,090
Now we have officially covered the topic.
That is basically all we need to know about

115
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,440
it.
But we will come back to that a bit later.

116
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,960
You will see. OK.
If there are no further questions, let me

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,500
continue and
go back to my list of topics. Oh, sorry.

118
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,240
I should have written down that this equation
is solved by

119
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:52,820
temperature for point x, y, z at time t.
OK. And there are, actually,

120
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,340
many other interesting partial differential
equations you will

121
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,190
maybe sometimes learn about the wave equation
that governs how

122
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:04,870
waves propagate in space, about the diffusion
equation,

123
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:11,030
when you have maybe a mixture of two fluids,
how they somehow mix over time and so on.

124
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,720
Basically, to every problem you might want
to consider there is

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:23,900
a partial differential equation to solve.
OK. Anyway. Sorry. Back to my list of topics.

126
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,930
One important application we have seen of
partial derivatives

127
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:36,120
is to try to optimize things, try to solve
minimum/maximum

128
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:47,210
problems.
Remember that we have introduced the notion

129
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,520
of
critical points of a function. A critical

130
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:03,540
point is when all
the partial derivatives are zero.

131
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,660
And then there are various kinds of critical
points.

132
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,290
There is maxima and there is minimum, but
there is also

133
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:22,600
saddle points. And we have seen a method using
second derivatives -- -- 
to decide which kind of critical

134
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:33,570
point we have. I should say that is for a
function of two variables to try to decide

135
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,750
whether a given
critical point is a minimum, a maximum or

136
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,960
a saddle point.
And we have also seen that actually that is

137
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,060
not enough to
find the minimum of a maximum of a function

138
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,890
because the minimum
of a maximum could occur on the boundary.

139
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,480
Just to give you a small reminder,
when you have a function of one variables,

140
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,510
if you are trying to find the minimum and
the maximum of a

141
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,740
function whose graph looks like this,
well, you are going to tell me, quite obviously,

142
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,290
that the maximum is this point up here.
And that is a point where the first derivative

143
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,460
is zero.
That is a critical point. And we used the

144
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,020
second
derivative to see that this critical point

145
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,130
is a local
maximum. But then, when we are looking

146
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,430
for the minimum of a function, well, it is
not at a critical

147
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,020
point. It is actually here at the
boundary of the domain, you know, the range

148
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,260
of values
that we are going to consider. Here the minimum

149
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,440
is at the
boundary. And the maximum is at a

150
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:52,089
critical point. Similarly, when you have a
function of several variables, say of two

151
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,779
variables,
for example, then the minimum and the

152
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,550
maximum will be achieved either at a critical
point.

153
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,930
And then we can use these methods to find
where they are.

154
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,770
Or, somewhere on the boundary of a set of
values that are

155
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,750
allowed. It could be that we actually
achieve a minimum by making x and y as small

156
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,580
as possible.
Maybe letting them go to zero if they had

157
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,660
to be positive or
maybe by making them go to infinity.

158
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,779
So, we have to keep our minds open and look
at various

159
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,070
possibilities. We are going to do a problem
like that. We are going to go over a

160
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,100
practice problem from the practice test to
clarify this.

161
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,920
Another important cultural application of
minimum/maximum

162
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,560
problems in two variables that we have seen
in class is the

163
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,810
least squared method to find the best fit
line,

164
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:53,720
or the best fit anything, really,
to find when you have a set of data points

165
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:01,660
what is the best
linear approximately for these data points.

166
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,240
And here I have some good news for you.
While you should definitely know what this

167
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:15,960
is about,
it will not be on the test.

168
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:33,180
[APPLAUSE] That doesn't mean that you
should forget everything we have seen about

169
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:47,029
it,
OK? Now what is next on my list of

170
00:15:47,029 --> 00:16:03,529
topics? We have seen differentials.
Remember the differential of f, by definition,

171
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,940
would be this kind of quantity. At first it
looks just like a

172
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,300
new way to package partial derivatives together
into some

173
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,350
new kind of object. Now, what is this good
for?

174
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,810
Well, it is a good way to remember approximation
formulas.

175
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,950
It is a good way to also study how variations
in x,

176
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:28,220
y, z relate to variations in f. In particular,
we can divide this by variations,

177
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,130
actually, by dx or by dy or by dz in any situation
that we

178
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:46,839
want, or by d of some other variable
to get chain rules. The chain rule says,

179
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:56,960
for example, there are many situations.
But, for example, if x, y and z depend on

180
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,360
some
other variable, say of variables maybe even

181
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,000
u
and v, then that means that f becomes

182
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,480
a function of u and v. And then we can ask
ourselves,

183
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:24,640
how sensitive is f to a value of u?
Well, we can answer that. The chain rule is

184
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,510
something
like this. And let me explain to you again

185
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:41,360
where this comes from. Basically, what this
quantity

186
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,640
means is if we change u and keep v constant,
what happens to the

187
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,770
value of f? Well, why would the value of f
change in the first place when f is just a

188
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,970
function of x,
y, z and not directly of you? Well, it changes

189
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,410
because x,
y and z depend on u. First we have to figure

190
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,000
out how
quickly x, y and z change when we change u.

191
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Well, how quickly they do that is precisely
partial x over

192
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,280
partial u, partial y over partial u, partial
z over

193
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,630
partial u. These are the rates of change
of x, y, z when we change u. And now, when

194
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,080
we change x,
y and z, that causes f to change.

195
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,280
How much does f change? Well, partial f over
partial x

196
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,200
tells us how quickly f changes if I just change
x.

197
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:33,130
I get this. That is the change in f caused
just by the fact that x changes when u changes.

198
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,520
But then y also changes. y changes at this
rate.

199
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,870
And that causes f to change at that rate.
And z changes as well, and that causes f to

200
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,650
change at
that rate. And the effects add up together.

201
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:59,050
Does that make sense? OK.
And so, in particular, we can use the chain

202
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,980
rule to do
changes of variables. If we have, say,

203
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,900
a function in terms of polar coordinates on
theta and we like

204
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,559
to switch it to rectangular coordinates x
and y then we can

205
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:22,660
use chain rules to relate the partial derivatives.
And finally, last but not least,

206
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:32,090
we have seen how to deal with non-independent
variables.

207
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,960
When our variables say x, y, z related by
some equation.

208
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,840
One way we can deal with this is to solve
for one of the

209
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,490
variables and go back to two independent variables,
but we cannot always do that. Of course, on

210
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,540
the exam,
you can be sure that I will make sure that

211
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,420
you cannot solve
for a variable you want to remove because

212
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,809
that would be too
easy. Then when we have to look at

213
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,679
all of them, we will have to take into account
this relation,

214
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:11,270
we have seen two useful methods.
One of them is to find the minimum of a maximum

215
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,860
of a
function when the variables are not independent,

216
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:34,549
and that is the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Remember, to 

217
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:47,160
find the minimum or the maximum of the function
f, subject to the constraint 
g

218
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:56,160
equals constant, well, we write down equations
that say that the gradient of f is actually

219
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,830
proportional to the
gradient of g. There is a new variable here,

220
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:12,380
lambda, the multiplier. And so, for example,
well, I guess here I had functions of three

221
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,520
variables,
so this becomes three equations.

222
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,510
f sub x equals lambda g sub x, f sub y equals
lambda g sub y,

223
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:27,170
and f sub z equals lambda g sub z.
And, when we plug in the formulas for f and

224
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,960
g,
well, we are left with three equations involving

225
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,280
the four
variables, x, y, z and lambda.

226
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,580
What is wrong? Well, we don't have actually
four independent variables. We also have this

227
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:46,410
relation,
whatever the constraint was relating x, y

228
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,860
and z together.
Then we can try to solve this. And, depending

229
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,620
on the
situation, it is sometimes easy. And it sometimes

230
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:00,890
it is very
hard or even impossible. But on the test,

231
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,549
I haven't decided yet, but it could well be
that the

232
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:06,090
problem about Lagrange multipliers just asks
you to

233
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:14,110
write the equations and not to solve them.
[APPLAUSE] Well, I don't know yet.

234
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,650
I am not promising anything. But, before you
start solving,

235
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,970
check whether the problem asks you to solve
them or not.

236
00:22:22,970 --> 00:23:06,590
If it doesn't then probably you shouldn't.
Another topic that we solved just yesterday

237
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,820
is constrained
partial derivatives. And I guess I have to

238
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,740
re-explain a little bit because my guess is
that things were not

239
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:25,510
extremely clear at the end of class yesterday.
Now we are in the same situation.

240
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:35,530
We have a function, let's say, f of x,
y, z where variables x, y and z are not independent

241
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,630
but
are constrained by some relation of this form.

242
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,010
Some quantity involving x, y and z is equal
to maybe zero

243
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,890
or some other constant. And then, what we
want to know,

244
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,669
is what is the rate of change of f with respect
to one of the

245
00:23:51,669 --> 00:24:01,380
variables, say, x, y or z when I keep the
others constant? Well, I cannot keep all the

246
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,200
other constant because that would not be compatible
with

247
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:13,780
this condition. I mean that would be the usual
or so-called formal partial derivative of

248
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,630
f ignoring the
constraint. To take this into account means

249
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,950
that if we vary one variable while keeping
another one fixed

250
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,360
then the third one, since it depends on them,
must also change somehow. And we must take

251
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,980
that into
account. Let's say, for example,

252
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,480
we want to find -- I am going to do a different
example from

253
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,370
yesterday. So, if you really didn't like
that one, you don't have to see it again.

254
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,360
Let's say that we want to find the partial
derivative of f with

255
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,240
respect to z keeping y constant. What does
that mean?

256
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:06,830
That means y is constant, z varies and x somehow
is

257
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,809
mysteriously a function of y and z for this
equation.

258
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,120
And then, of course because it depends on
y,

259
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,549
that means x will vary. Sorry, depends on
y and z and z

260
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:23,980
varies. Now we are asking ourselves
what is the rate of change of f with respect

261
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:42,650
to z in this
situation?

262
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:49,080
And so we have two methods to do that.
Let me start with the one with differentials

263
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:56,640
that hopefully you
kind of understood yesterday, but if not here

264
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:05,540
is a second
chance. Using differentials means that

265
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,799
we will try to express df in terms of dz in
this particular

266
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:18,790
situation. What do we know about df in
general? Well, we know that df is f sub

267
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:27,360
x dx plus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz.
That is the general statement. But, of course,

268
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,030
we are in a special case. We are in a special
case where

269
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,040
first y is constant. y is constant means that
we can

270
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:49,929
set dy to be zero. This goes away and becomes
zero.

271
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,910
The second thing is actually we don't care
about x.

272
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,400
We would like to get rid of x because it is
this dependent

273
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:08,260
variable. What we really want to do is
express df only in terms of dz. What we need

274
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:15,510
is to relate dx
with dz. Well, to do that,

275
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,850
we need to look at how the variables are related
so we need

276
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,070
to look at the constraint g. Well, how do
we do that?

277
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:30,260
We look at the differential g. So dg is g
sub x dx plus g sub

278
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,240
y dy plus g sub z dz. And that is zero because
we are

279
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,780
setting g to always stay constant.
So, g doesn't change. If g doesn't change

280
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,340
then we
have a relation between dx, dy and dz.

281
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,330
Well, in fact, we say we are going to look
only at the case where y is constant.

282
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:59,179
y doesn't change and this becomes zero.
Well, now we have a relation between dx and

283
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,980
dz.
We know how x depends on z. And when we know

284
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,480
how x depends
on z, we can plug that into here and get how

285
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:23,809
f depends on z.
Let's do that.

286
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:32,940
Again, saying that g cannot change and keeping
y constant

287
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,730
tells us g sub x dx plus g sub z dz is zero
and we would like to

288
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:46,539
solve for dx in terms of dz. That tells us
dx should be

289
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:56,090
minus g sub z dz divided by g sub x.
If you want, this is the rate of change of

290
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,360
x
with respect to z when we keep y constant.

291
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:09,630
In our new terminology this is partial x over
partial z with y

292
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:17,520
held constant. This is the rate of change
of x

293
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:29,809
with respect to z. Now, when we know that,
we are going to plug that into this equation.

294
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:37,090
And that will tell us that df is f sub x times
dx.

295
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,289
Well, what is dx? dx is now minus g sub z
over g

296
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:49,820
sub x dz plus f sub z dz. So that will be
minus fx g sub

297
00:29:49,820 --> 00:30:00,720
z over g sub x plus f sub z times dz.
And so this coefficient here is the rate of

298
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,650
change of f with
respect to z in the situation we are considering.

299
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:12,630
This quantity is what we call partial f over
partial z with y

300
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:23,980
held constant. That is what we wanted to find.
Now, let's see another way to do the same

301
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:56,720
calculation and then
you can choose which one you prefer.

302
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:13,100
The other method is using the chain rule.
We use the chain rule to understand how f

303
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,270
depends on z
when y is held constant. Let me first try

304
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,710
the chain rule
brutally and then we will try to analyze what

305
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:26,970
is going on.
You can just use the version that I have up

306
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,580
there as a
template to see what is going on, but I am

307
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:50,460
going to explain it
more carefully again.

308
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:57,970
That is the most mechanical and mindless way
of writing down the

309
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,220
chain rule. I am just saying here that I am
varying z, keeping y constant, and I want

310
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,340
to know how f
changes. Well, f might change because x

311
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:13,929
might change, y might change and z might
change. Now, how quickly does x change?

312
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,600
Well, the rate of change of x in this situation
is partial x,

313
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,350
partial z with y held constant. If I change
x at this rate then

314
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:31,919
f will change at that rate. Now, y might change,
so the rate of change of y would be the rate

315
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,620
of change of y
with respect to z holding y constant.

316
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,039
Wait a second. If y is held constant then
y

317
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,500
doesn't change. So, actually,
this guy is zero and you didn't really have

318
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,929
to write that term.
But I wrote it just to be systematic.

319
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,880
If y had been somehow able to change at a
certain rate then

320
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,659
that would have caused f to change at that
rate.

321
00:32:53,659 --> 00:33:00,830
And, of course, if y is held constant then
nothing happens here. Finally, while z is

322
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,740
changing at
a certain rate, this rate is this one and

323
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,710
that
causes f to change at that rate. And then

324
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,700
we add the effects
together. See, it is nothing but the

325
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,520
good-old chain rule. Just I have put these
extra

326
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,530
subscripts to tell us what is held constant
and what isn't.

327
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,960
Now, of course we can simplify it a little
bit more.

328
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,950
Because, here, how quickly does z change if
I

329
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,350
am changing z? Well, the rate of change of
z,

330
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:40,539
with respect to itself, is just one.
In fact, the really mysterious part of this

331
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:44,200
is the one here,
which is the rate of change of x with respect

332
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,789
to z.
And, to find that, we have to understand the

333
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:54,280
constraint. How can we find the rate of
change of x with respect to z? Well, we could

334
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,980
use
differentials, like we did here,

335
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:20,599
but we can also keep using the chain rule.
How can I do that? Well, I can just look at

336
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:24,089
how g
would change with respect to z when y is held

337
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,589
constant.
I just do the same calculation with g instead

338
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:35,690
of f.
But, before I do it, let's ask ourselves first

339
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,769
what
is this equal to. Well, if g is held constant

340
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:45,789
then, when we vary z keeping y constant and
changing x,

341
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:56,889
well, g still doesn't change. It is held constant.
In fact, that should be zero. But, if we just

342
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,160
say that,
we are not going to get to that.

343
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,529
Let's see how we can compute that using the
chain rule.

344
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:08,380
Well, the chain rule tells us g changes because
x,

345
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,549
y and z change. How does it change because
of x?

346
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:18,359
Well, partial g over partial x times the rate
of change of x.

347
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,420
How does it change because of y? Well, partial
g over partial y

348
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,489
times the rate of change of y. But, of course,
if you are smarter than me then you don't

349
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:31,089
need to actually write
this one because y is held constant.

350
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:38,200
And then there is the rate of change because
z changes.

351
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,309
And how quickly z changes here, of course,
is one.

352
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:53,710
Out of this you get, well, I am tired of writing
partial g over partial x. We can just write

353
00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:00,109
g sub x times
partial x over partial z y constant plus g

354
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:07,869
sub z.
And now we found how x depends on z.

355
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:16,119
Partial x over partial z with y held constant
is negative g sub

356
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,380
z over g sub x. Now we plug that into that
and

357
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:32,059
we get our answer. It goes all the way up
here.

358
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,839
And then we get the answer. I am not going
to,

359
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:51,440
well, I guess I can write it again.
There was partial f over partial x times this

360
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,979
guy,
minus g sub z over g sub x, plus partial f

361
00:36:55,979 --> 00:37:01,630
over partial z.
And you can observe that this is exactly the

362
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,259
same formula that
we had over here. In fact, let's compare this

363
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,190
to
make it side by side. I claim we did exactly

364
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,239
the same
thing, just with different notations.

365
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,819
If you take the differential of f and you
divide it by dz in

366
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,170
this situation where y is held constant and
so on,

367
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:28,849
you get exactly this chain rule up there.
That chain rule up there is this guy, df,

368
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:36,729
divided by dz with y held constant.
And the term involving dy was replaced by

369
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:40,489
zero on both sides
because we knew, actually, that y is held

370
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:47,109
constant. Now, the real difficulty in
both cases comes from dx. And what we do about

371
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,739
dx is we
use the constant. Here we use it by writing

372
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:54,049
dg
equals zero. Here we write the chain rule

373
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:58,190
for g, which is the same thing, just divided
by dz with y held

374
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:07,319
constant. This formula or that formula
are the same, just divided by dz with y held

375
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:13,849
constant. And then, in both cases,
we used that to solve for dx. And then we

376
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:18,380
plugged into the
formula of df to express df over dz, or partial

377
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,589
f,
partial z with y held constant. So, the two

378
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:27,539
methods are pretty
much the same. Quick poll.

379
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:34,130
Who prefers this one? Who prefers that one?
OK. Majority vote seems to be for

380
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,799
differentials, but it doesn't mean that it
is

381
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:41,349
better. Both are fine.
You can use whichever one you want.

382
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:58,759
But you should give both a try. OK. Any questions?
Yes? Yes. Thank you.

383
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:06,129
I forgot to mention it. Where did that go?
I think I erased that part. We need to know

384
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:19,279
-- --
directional derivatives. Pretty much the only

385
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:22,140
thing to
remember about them is that df over ds,

386
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,969
in the direction of some unit vector u,
is just the gradient f dot product with u.

387
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:37,849
That is pretty much all we know about them.
Any other topics that I forgot to list?

388
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:45,259
No. Yes?
Can I erase three boards at a time?

389
00:39:45,259 --> 00:40:05,999
No, I would need three hands to do that.
I think what we should do now is look quickly

390
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:09,589
at the practice
test. I mean, given the time,

391
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:16,779
you will mostly have to think about it yourselves.
Hopefully you have a copy of the practice

392
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:26,479
exam.
The first problem is a simple problem.

393
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:30,609
Find the gradient. Find an approximation formula.
Hopefully you know how to do that.

394
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,829
The second problem is one about writing a
contour plot.

395
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:36,009
And so, before I let you go for the weekend,
I want to make sure

396
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:47,539
that you actually know how to read a contour
plot.

397
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:52,749
One thing I should mention is this problem
asks you to

398
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:55,190
estimate partial derivatives by writing a
contour plot.

399
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,089
We have not done that, so that will not actually
be on

400
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:01,529
the test. We will be doing qualitative
questions like what is the sine of a partial

401
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,900
derivative.
Is it zero, less than zero or more than zero?

402
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,660
You don't need to bring a ruler to estimate
partial derivatives

403
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:37,279
the way that this problem asks you to.
[APPLAUSE] Let's look at problem 2B.

404
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:42,479
Problem 2B is asking you to find the point
at which h equals

405
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:47,900
2200, partial h over partial x equals
zero and partial h over partial y is less

406
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,269
than zero.
Let's try and see what is going on here.

407
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:57,309
A point where f equals 2200, well, that should
be probably

408
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:07,450
on the level curve that says 2200.
We can actually zoom in. Here is the level

409
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,459
2200.
Now I want partial h over partial x to be

410
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:15,959
zero.
That means if I change x, keeping y constant,

411
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:23,099
the value of h doesn't change. Which points
on the level curve

412
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,690
satisfy that property? It is the top and the
bottom.

413
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,709
If you are here, for example, and you move
in the x

414
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:38,150
direction, well, you see,
as you get to there from the left,

415
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,529
the height first increases and then decreases.
It goes for a maximum at that point.

416
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:46,789
So, at that point, the partial derivative
is zero

417
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:57,700
with respect to x. And the same here.
Now, let's find partial h over partial y less

418
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,259
than zero.
That means if we go north we should go down.

419
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:10,700
Well, which one is it, top or bottom?
Top. Yes. Here, if you go north,

420
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:22,009
then you go from 2200 down to 2100.
This is where the point is. Now, the problem

421
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:24,819
here was also
asking you to estimate partial h over partial

422
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,849
y.
And if you were curious how you would do that,

423
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:31,099
well, you would try to figure out how long
it takes before you

424
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:42,519
reach the next level curve. To go from here
to here,

425
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,019
to go from Q to this new point, say Q prime,
the change in y, well, you would have to read

426
00:43:49,019 --> 00:44:00,589
the scale, which was down here,
would be about something like 300.

427
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:04,029
What is the change in height when you go from
Q to Q prime?

428
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:13,509
Well, you go down from 2200 to 2100.
That is actually minus 100 exactly.

429
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:22,660
OK? And so delta h over delta y is
about minus one-third, well, minus 100 over

430
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:34,709
300 which
is 
minus one-third. And that is an approximation

431
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:41,759
for partial derivative. So, that is how you
would do it.

432
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:49,880
Now, let me go back to other things.
If you look at this practice exam, basically

433
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,950
there is a bit
of everything and it is kind of fairly representative

434
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:59,309
of what
might happen on Tuesday. There will be a mix

435
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:03,029
of easy
problems and of harder problems. Expect something

436
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:05,180
about
computing gradients, approximations,

437
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:13,400
rate of change. Expect a problem about reading
a contour plot. Expect one about a min/max

438
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,719
problem, something about Lagrange
multipliers, something about the chain rule

439
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,579
and something about constrained partial derivatives.
I mean pretty much all the topics are going

440
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:21,979
to be there.
