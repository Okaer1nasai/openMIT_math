6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:32,320
so -- OK, so remember last time,
on Tuesday we learned about the chain rule,

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,870
and so for example we saw that if we have
a function that

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:48,370
depends, sorry, on three variables,
x,y,z, that x,y,z themselves depend on

9
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:58,679
some variable, t,
then you can find a formula for df/dt by writing

10
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:10,630
down wx/dx dt
wy dy/dt wz dz/dt. And, the meaning of that

11
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,009
formula is that while the change in w is caused
by changes in x,

12
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:24,060
y, and z, x, y, and z change at rates dx/dt,
dy/dt, dz/dt. And, this causes a function

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,180
to
change accordingly using, well, the partial

14
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,689
derivatives
tell you how sensitive w is to changes in

15
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,270
each variable.
OK, so, we are going to just rewrite this

16
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,610
in a new notation.
So, I'm going to rewrite this in a more concise

17
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:54,820
form as
gradient of w dot product with velocity vector

18
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:04,420
dr/dt.
So, the gradient of w is a vector formed by

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,020
putting
together all of the partial derivatives.

20
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,019
OK, so it's the vector whose components are
the partials.

21
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,760
And, of course, it's a vector that depends
on

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,019
x, y, and z, right? These guys depend on x,
y, z.

23
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:30,480
So, it's actually one vector for each point,
x, y, z. You can talk about the gradient

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:41,730
of w at some point, x, y, z.
So, at each point, it gives you a vector.

25
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,459
That actually is what we will call later a
vector field.

26
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:55,650
We'll get back to that later. And, dr/dt is
just the velocity

27
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:13,680
vector dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt.
OK, so the new definition for today is the

28
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,959
definition of the
gradient vector. And, our goal will be to

29
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,170
understand a bit better, what does this vector
mean?

30
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,730
What does it measure? And, what can we do
with it?

31
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,750
But, you see that in terms of information
content,

32
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,099
it's really the same information that's already
in

33
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:42,790
the partial derivatives, or in the differential.
So, yes, and 

34
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,519
I should say, of course you can also use the
gradient and other things like approximation

35
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,680
formulas and so
on. And so far, it's just notation.

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,799
It's a way to rewrite things. But, so here's
the first cool

37
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,709
property of the gradient. So, I claim that
the gradient

38
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:13,730
vector is perpendicular to the level surface
corresponding to

39
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:25,200
setting the function, w, equal to a constant.
OK, so if I draw a contour plot of my function,

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,140
so, actually forget about z because I want
to draw a two

41
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,290
variable contour plot. So, say I have a function
of

42
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,960
two variables, x and y, then maybe it has
some

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,660
contour plot. And, I'm saying if I take the
gradient of a function at this point, (x,y).

44
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,360
So, I will have a vector. Well, if I draw
that vector on

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,610
top of a contour plot, it's going to end up
being

46
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:56,570
perpendicular to the level curve.
Same thing if I have a function of three variables.

47
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,320
Then, I can try to draw its contour plot.
Of course, I can't really do it because the

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,890
contour plot would
be living in space with x, y, and z.

49
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,040
But, it would be a bunch of level faces, and
the gradient

50
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,390
vector would be a vector in space.
That vector is perpendicular to the level

51
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:21,270
faces.
So, let's try to see that on a couple of examples.

52
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:32,720
So, let's do a first example. What's the easiest
case?

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,160
Let's take a linear function of x, y, and
z.

54
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,660
So, I will take w equals a1 times x plus a2
times y plus a3

55
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:50,880
times z. Well, so, what's the gradient
of this function? Well, the first component

56
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,220
will
be a1. That's partial w partial x.

57
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,740
Then, a2, that's partial w partial y, and
a3,

58
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:12,430
partial w partial z. Now, what is the levels
of this?

59
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:19,300
Well, if I set w equal to some constant, c,
that means I look

60
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:29,920
at the points where a1x a2y a3z equals c.
What kind of service is that? It's a plane.

61
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,550
And, we know how to find a normal vector to
this plane just

62
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:46,020
by looking at the coefficients. So, it's a
plane with a normal

63
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,960
vector exactly this gradient. And, in fact,
in a way, this is the only case you need to

64
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,310
check because of
linear approximations. If you replace a function

65
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,930
by
its linear approximation, that means you will

66
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,970
replace the
level surfaces by their tension planes.

67
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,450
And then, you'll actually end up in this situation.
But maybe that's not very convincing.

68
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:25,340
So, let's do another example. So, let's do
a second example.

69
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,440
Let's say we look at the function x^2 y^2.
OK, so now it's a function of just two variables

70
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,960
because that
way we'll be able to actually draw a picture

71
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,920
for you.
OK, so what are the level sets of this function?

72
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:50,420
Well, they're going to be circles, right?
w equals c is a circle, x^2 y^2 = c.

73
00:07:50,420 --> 00:08:02,840
So, I should say, maybe, sorry,
the level curve is a circle. So, the contour

74
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:13,630
plot looks
something like that. Now, what's the gradient

75
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,140
vector?
Well, the gradient of this function, so,

76
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,840
partial w partial x is 2x. And partial w partial
y is 2y.

77
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,940
So, let's say I take a point, x comma y, and
I try to draw my

78
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,450
gradient vector. So, here at x,
y, so, I have to draw the vector, <2x,

79
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,840
2y>. What does it look like?
Well, it's going in that direction.

80
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,430
It's parallel to the position vector for this
point.

81
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,830
It's actually twice the position vector.
So, I guess it goes more or less like this.

82
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,760
What's interesting, too, is it is perpendicular
to

83
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:09,250
this circle. OK, so it's a general feature.
Actually, let me show you more examples, oops,

84
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,080
not the one I want. So, I don't know if you
can see

85
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,530
it so well. Well, hopefully you can.
So, here I have a contour plot of a function,

86
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,270
and I have a blue vector. That's the gradient
vector at

87
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:33,400
the pink point on the plot. So, you can see,
I can move the pink point, and the gradient

88
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,280
vector,
of course, changes because the gradient depends

89
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,820
on x and y.
But, what doesn't change is that it's always

90
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,700
perpendicular
to the level curves. Anywhere I am,

91
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,500
my gradient stays perpendicular to the level
curve.

92
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,180
OK, is that convincing? Is that visible for
people who

93
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:09,830
can't see blue? OK, so, OK, so we have a lot
of

94
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,300
evidence, but let's try to prove the theorem
because it will be

95
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:26,030
interesting. So, first of all,
sorry, any questions about the statement,

96
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:34,820
the example,
anything, yes? Ah, very good question.

97
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,090
Does the gradient vector, why is the gradient
vector

98
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,720
perpendicular in one direction rather than
the other?

99
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,780
So, we'll see the answer to that in a few
minutes.

100
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,020
But let me just tell you immediately, to the
side,

101
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,620
which side it's pointing to, it's always pointing
towards

102
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,780
higher values of a function. OK, and we'll
see in that maybe

103
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:11,590
about half an hour. So, well, let me say actually
points towards higher values of w.

104
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:27,950
OK, any other questions? I don't see any questions.
OK, so let's try to prove this theorem, at

105
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,490
least this part of
the theorem. We're not going to prove that

106
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:44,230
just yet. That will come in a while.
So, well, maybe we want to understand first

107
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,820
what happens if
we move inside the level curve, OK?

108
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,110
So, let's imagine that we are taking a moving
point that stays

109
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,620
on the level curve or on the level surface.
And then, we know, well, what happens is that

110
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,860
the
function stays constant. But, we can also

111
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,590
know how
quickly the function changes using the chain

112
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,340
rule up there.
So, maybe the chain rule will actually be

113
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,900
the key to
understanding how the gradient vector and

114
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:21,130
the motion on the
level service relate. So, let's take a curve,

115
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:38,890
r equals r of t, that stays inside,
well, maybe I should say on the level surface,

116
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:50,440
w equals c. So, let's think about what that
means. So, just to get you used to

117
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,230
this idea, I'm going to draw a level surface
of a function of

118
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,590
three variables. OK, so it's a surface given
by

119
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:07,360
the equation w of x, y, z equals some constant,
c. And, so now I'm going to have a

120
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,740
point on that, and it's going to move on that
surface. So, I will have some parametric

121
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:24,980
curve that lives on this surface.
So, the question is, what's going to happen

122
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,010
at any
given time? Well, the first observation is

123
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,260
that the velocity vector, what can I say about
the

124
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,090
velocity vector of this motion? It's going
to be tangent to the

125
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,600
level surface, right?
If I move on a surface, then at any point,

126
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,450
my velocity is tangent to the curve.
But, if it's tangent to the curve, then it's

127
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,510
also tangent to
the surface because the curve is inside the

128
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,950
surface.
So, OK, it's getting a bit cluttered.

129
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:04,230
Maybe I should draw a bigger picture.
Let me do that right away here. So, I have

130
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:15,150
my level surface,
w equals c. I have a curve on that,

131
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:26,690
and at some point, I'm going to have a certain
velocity. So, the claim is that the

132
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:48,980
velocity, v, equals dr/dt is tangent -- --
to the level, w equals c because it's tangent

133
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,990
to the curve, and the curve is inside the
level, OK?

134
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:59,190
Now, what else can we say? Well, we have,
the chain rule will tell us how the value

135
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:10,420
of w changes.
So, by the chain rule, we have dw/dt.

136
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,180
So, the rate of change of the value of w as
I move along this

137
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:23,040
curve is given by the dot product between
the gradient and

138
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:45,720
the velocity vector. And, so, well,
maybe I can rewrite it as w dot v, and that

139
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,580
should be,
well, what should it be? What happens to the

140
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,440
value of w
as t changes? Well, it stays constant because

141
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
we are moving on a curve. That curve might
be

142
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:08,950
complicated, but it stays always on the level,
w equals c. So, it's zero because w of t

143
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:16,850
equals c, which is a constant. OK, is that
convincing?

144
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,040
OK, so now if we have a dot product that's
zero,

145
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:36,870
that tells us that these two guys are perpendicular.
So -- 
So if the gradient vector is perpendicular

146
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,370
to v,
OK, that's a good start. We know that the

147
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,110
gradient is
perpendicular to this vector tangent that's

148
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,370
tangent to the
level surface. What about other vectors

149
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,380
tangent to the level surface? Well, in fact,
I could use any curve drawn on the level of

150
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,480
w equals c.
So, I could move, really, any way I wanted

151
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,130
on
that surface. In particular,

152
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,980
I claim that I could have chosen my velocity
vector to be

153
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:20,110
any vector tangent to the surface.
OK, so let's write this. So this is true for

154
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:31,220
any curve,
or, I'll say for any motion on the level surface,

155
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:49,190
w equals c. So that means v can be any
vector tangent to the surface tangent to the

156
00:17:49,190 --> 00:18:01,640
level.
See, for example, OK, let me draw one more

157
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,620
picture. OK, so I have my level surface.
So, I'm drawing more and more levels, and

158
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,570
they never quite
look the same. But I have a point.

159
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,730
And, at this point, I have the tangent plane
to the

160
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:24,929
level surface. OK, so this is tangent plane
to

161
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:34,120
the level. Then, if I choose any vector in
that tangent plane. Let's say I choose the

162
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,580
one that
goes in that direction. Then, I can actually

163
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,380
find a
curve that goes in that direction, and stays

164
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,460
on the
level. So, here, that would be a curve

165
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,550
that somehow goes from the right to the left,
and of course it

166
00:18:47,550 --> 00:19:04,880
has to end up going up or something like that.
OK, so given any vector tangent -- -- let's

167
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:16,510
call that vector v
tangent to the level, we get that the gradient

168
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,790
is
perpendicular to v. So, if the gradient is

169
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,910
perpendicular to this vector tangent to this
curve,

170
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,900
but also to any vector, I can draw that tangent
to my

171
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,130
surface. So, what does that mean?
Well, that means the gradient is actually

172
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,770
perpendicular to the
tangent plane or to the surface at this point.

173
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:55,010
So, the gradient is perpendicular.
And, well, here, I've illustrated things with

174
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:06,290
a
three-dimensional example, but really it works

175
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,460
the same if
you have only two variables. Then you have

176
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,679
a level curve
that has a tangent line, and the gradient

177
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:21,460
is
perpendicular to that line. OK, any questions?

178
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:37,860
No? OK, so, let's see.
That's actually pretty neat because there

179
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,450
is a nice
application of this, which is to try to figure

180
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,220
out,
now we know, actually, how to find the

181
00:20:44,220 --> 00:21:18,690
tangent plane to anything, pretty much.
OK, so let's see. So, let's say that,

182
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:41,440
for example, I want to find -- -- 
the
tangent plane -- -- 
to the surface with equation,

183
00:21:41,440 --> 00:22:00,000
let's say, x^2 y^2-z^2 = 4 at the point (2,1,
1). Let me write that.

184
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,130
So, how do we do that? Well, one way that
we already

185
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:11,309
know, if we solve this for z,
so we can write z equals a function of x and

186
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,720
y,
then we know tangent plane approximation for

187
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
the graph of a
function, z equals some function of x and

188
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,480
y. But, that doesn't look like
it's the best way to do it. OK, the best way

189
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,940
to it,
now that we have the gradient vector, is actually

190
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,809
to directly
say, oh, we know the normal vector to this

191
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,890
plane.
The normal vector will just be the gradient.

192
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:41,840
Oh, I think I have a cool picture to show.
OK, so that's what it looks like.

193
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,010
OK, so here you have the surface x2 y2-z2
equals four.

194
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,890
That's called a hyperboloid because it looks
like when you

195
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:59,929
get when you spin a hyperbola around an axis.
And, here's a tangent plane at the given point.

196
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,600
So, it doesn't look very tangent because it
crosses the

197
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,230
surface. But, it's really,
if you think about it, you will see it's really

198
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,190
the
plane that's approximating the surface in

199
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,880
the best way that you
can at this given point. It is really the

200
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:26,410
tangent plane.
So, how do we find this plane? Well, you can

201
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,520
plot it on a
computer. That's not exactly how you

202
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,480
would look for it in the first place.
So, the way to do it is that we compute the

203
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,780
gradient.
So, a gradient of what? Well, a gradient of

204
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,990
this
function. OK, so I should say,

205
00:23:48,990 --> 00:24:04,280
this is the level set, w equals four,
where w equals x^2 y^2 - z^2. And so, we know

206
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:14,110
that the
gradient of this, well, what is it?

207
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:25,970
2x, then 2y, and then negative 2z.
So, at this given point, I guess we are at

208
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,890
x equals two.
So, that's four. And then, y and z are one.

209
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:36,980
So, two, negative two. OK, and that's going
to be the

210
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:44,929
normal vector to the surface or to the tangent
plane.

211
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,770
That's one way to define the tangent plane.
All right, it has the same normal vector as

212
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,419
the surface.
That's one way to define the normal vector

213
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,280
to the surface,
if you prefer. Being perpendicular to the

214
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,650
surface means that you are perpendicular to
its tangent

215
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:16,750
plane. OK, so the equation is,
well, 4x 2y-2z equals something, where something

216
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,960
is,
well, we should just plug in that point.

217
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,640
We'll get eight plus two minus two looks like
we'll get eight.

218
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,860
And, of course, we could simplify dividing
everything by two, but it's not very important

219
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,200
here. OK, so now if you have a
surface given by an evil equation,

220
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,799
and a point on the surface, well, you know
how to find the

221
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:50,179
tangent plane to the surface at that point.
OK, any questions? No.

222
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:57,040
OK, let me give just another reason why, another
way that we

223
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:05,290
could have seen this. So, I claim,
in fact, we could have done this without the

224
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,380
gradient,
or using the gradient in a somehow disguised

225
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:17,559
way.
So, here's another way. So, the other way

226
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,400
to do it
would be to start with a differential,

227
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,960
OK? dw, while it's pretty much the
same content, but let me write it as a

228
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:41,799
differential, dw is 2xdx 2ydy-2zdz.
So, at a given point, at (2,1, 1),

229
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:53,440
this is 4dx 2dy-2dz. Now, if we want to change
this

230
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:03,030
into an approximation formula, we can.
We know that the change in w is approximately

231
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:16,059
equal to 4 delta x
2 delta y - 2 delta z. OK, so when do we stay

232
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,290
on the
level surface? Well, we stay on the level

233
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:22,240
surface when w doesn't change, so, when this
becomes zero,

234
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,210
OK? Now, what does this
approximation sign mean? Well, it means for

235
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,900
small
changes in x, y, z, this guy will be close

236
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,549
to
that guy. It also means something else.

237
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,030
Remember, these approximation formulas, they
are linear

238
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,130
approximations. They mean that we replace
the

239
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,320
function, actually, by some closest linear
formula

240
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:51,299
that will be nearby. And so, in particular,
if we set this equal to zero instead of approximately

241
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,360
zero,
it means we'll actually be moving on the tangent

242
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,559
plane to
the level set. If you want strict equalities

243
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,750
in approximations means that we replace the
function by its

244
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:45,309
tangent approximation.
So -- [APPLAUSE] OK, so 
the level corresponds to

245
00:28:45,309 --> 00:29:01,470
delta w equals zero, and its tangent plane
corresponds to four delta x plus two delta

246
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:08,539
y minus two delta z
equals zero. That's what I'm trying to say,

247
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,200
basically. And, what's delta x?
Well, that means it's the change in x.

248
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,110
So, what's the change in x here? That means,
well,

249
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,710
we started with x equals two, and we moved
to some other

250
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:27,280
value, x. So, that's actually x- 2, right?
That's how much x has changed compared to

251
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:35,629
2.
And, two times (y - 1) minus two times z - 1

252
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:42,150
= 0.
That's the equation of a tangent plane.

253
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,900
It's the same equation as the one over there.
These are just two different methods to get

254
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,169
it.
OK, so this one explains to you what's going

255
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:56,840
on in terms of
approximation formulas. This one goes right

256
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,070
away,
by using the gradient factor. So, in a way,

257
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:09,820
with this one, you don't have to think nearly
as much. But, you can use either one.

258
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:23,470
OK, questions? No?
OK, so let's move on to new topic, which is

259
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:29,940
another
application of a gradient vector, and that

260
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:40,080
is directional
derivatives.

261
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:51,120
OK, so let's say that we have a function of
two variables,

262
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,299
x and y. Well, we know how to compute
partial w over partial x or partial w over

263
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:05,330
partial y,
which measure how w changes if I move in the

264
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,490
direction of the x
axis or in the direction of the y axis.

265
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,159
So, what about moving in other directions?
Well, of course, we've seen other approximation

266
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,870
formulas and so on. But, we can still ask,
is there a derivative in every direction?

267
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:30,419
And that's basically, yes, that's the directional
derivative. OK, so these are derivatives in

268
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:39,880
the direction of I hat or j hat, the vectors
that go along the x

269
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:55,200
or the y axis. So, what if we move in another
direction, let's say, the direction of some

270
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:08,450
unit
vector, let's call it u . OK, so if I give

271
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,380
you a unit
vector, you can ask yourself, if I move in

272
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,620
the direction,
how quickly will my function change?

273
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:33,400
So -- So, let's look at the straight trajectory.
What this should mean is I start at some value,

274
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,970
x, y, and there I have my vector u.
And, I'm going to move in a straight line

275
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,520
in the direction
of u. And, I have the graph of my

276
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:57,549
function -- -- 
and I'm asking myself how quickly does the
value change when I move on the graph in that

277
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:05,929
direction?
OK, so let's look at a straight line trajectory

278
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:19,539
So,
we have a position vector, r, that will depend

279
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:24,220
on some
parameter which I will call s. You'll see

280
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,870
why very soon,
in such a way that the derivative is this

281
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,120
given unit
vector u hat. So, why do I use s for my

282
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,070
parameter rather than t. Well, it's a convention.
I'm moving at unit speed along this line.

283
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,789
So that means that actually, I'm parameterizing
things by

284
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:52,280
the distance that I've traveled along a curve,
sorry, along this line. So, here it's called

285
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,570
s in the
sense of arc length. Actually, it's not really

286
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,590
an
arc because it's a straight line, so it's

287
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:09,829
the distance along
the line. OK, so because we are

288
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,229
parameterizing by distance, we are just using
s as a

289
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:18,609
convention just to distinguish it from other
situations.

290
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:31,059
And, so, now, the question will be,
what is dw/ds? What's the rate of change of

291
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:35,279
w
when I move like that? Well, of course we

292
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,389
know the
answer because that's a special case of the

293
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:43,279
chain rule.
So, that's how we will actually compute it.

294
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:48,799
But, in terms of what it means, it really
means we are asking

295
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:54,200
ourselves, we start at a point and we
change the variables in a certain direction,

296
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,619
which is not necessarily the x or the y direction,
but really any direction. And then, what's

297
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:04,880
the derivative
in that direction? OK, does that make sense

298
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,239
as a
concept? Kind of?

299
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,809
I see some faces that are not completely convinced.
So, maybe you should show more pictures.

300
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:40,880
Well, let me first write down a bit more and
show you something.

301
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,359
So I just want to give you the actual definition.
Sorry, first of all in case you wonder what

302
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,009
this is all about,
so let's say the components of our unit vector

303
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:59,489
are two numbers,
a and b. Then, it means we'll move along

304
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:06,839
the line x of s equals some initial value,
the point where we are actually at the directional

305
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:11,759
derivative
plus s times a, or I meant to say plus a times

306
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:34,849
s. And, y of s equals y0 bs.
And then, we plug that into w. 
And then we take the derivative.

307
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:46,180
So, we have a notation for that which is going
to be dw/ds with

308
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:52,069
a subscript in the direction of u to indicate
in which direction

309
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:59,690
we are actually going to move. And, that's
called the

310
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:11,279
directional derivative -- -- 

311
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:23,960
in the direction of u.
OK, so, let's see what it means geometrically.

312
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:35,589
So, remember, we've seen things about partial
derivatives, and we see that the partial

313
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:40,950
derivatives are the slopes of slices of the
graph by vertical

314
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,410
planes that are parallel to the x or the y
directions.

315
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:53,640
OK, so, if I have a point, at any point,
I can slice the graph of my function by two

316
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,160
planes,
one that's going along the x, one along the

317
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,640
y direction.
And then, I can look at the slices of the

318
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,680
graph.
Let me see if I can use that thing.

319
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,999
So, we can look at the slices of the graph
that are drawn

320
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:13,039
here. In fact, we look at the tangent
lines to the slices, and we look at the slope

321
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,759
and
that gives us the partial derivatives in case

322
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,009
you are on
that side and want to see also the pointer

323
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:25,009
that was here.
So, now, similarly, the directional derivative

324
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:32,469
means, actually, we'll be slicing our graph
by

325
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:41,579
the vertical plane. It's not really colorful,
something more colorful. We'll be slicing

326
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,890
things by a
plane that is now in the direction of this

327
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,920
vector,
u, and we'll be looking at the slope of the

328
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,700
slice of the graph.
So, what that looks like here, so that's the

329
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,690
same applet the
way that you've used on your problem set in

330
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:09,029
case you are
wondering. So, now, I'm picking a point on

331
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:14,660
the contour plot. And, at that point,
I slice the graph. So, here I'm starting by

332
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,119
slicing in the direction of the x axis.
So, in fact, what I'm measuring here by the

333
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,910
slope of the slice is the partial in the x
direction.

334
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,900
It's really partial f partial x, which is
also the directional

335
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:36,170
derivative in the direction of i.
And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have

336
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,420
all of these
planes. So, you see at the bottom left,

337
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,609
I have the direction in which I'm going.
There's this, like, rotating line that tells

338
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,920
you in which direction I'm going to be moving.
And for each direction, I have a plane.

339
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,039
And, when I slice by that plane, I will get,
so I have this direction here going maybe

340
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:59,219
to the southwest.
So, that gives me a slice of my graph by a

341
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,749
vertical plane,
and the slice has a certain slope.

342
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:06,299
And, the slope is going to be the directional
derivative in

343
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:20,969
that direction. OK, I think that's as graphic
as I can get. OK, any questions about that?

344
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:40,390
No? OK, so let's see how we compute
that guy. So, let me just write again

345
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:46,549
just in case you want to, in case you didn't
hear me it's

346
00:40:46,549 --> 00:41:01,289
the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical
plane -- --

347
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,579
that contains the given direction,
that's parallel to the direction, u.

348
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:11,539
So, how do we compute it? Well, we can use
the chain rule.

349
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:22,769
The chain rule implies that dw/ds is actually
the gradient

350
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:30,719
of w dot product with the velocity vector
dr/ds.

351
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,299
But, remember we say that we are going to
be moving at unit

352
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:42,259
speed in the direction of u. So, in fact,
that's just gradient w dot product with the

353
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:53,479
unit vector u.
OK, so the formula that we remember is really

354
00:41:53,479 --> 00:42:01,339
dw/ds in the
direction of u is gradient w dot product of

355
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:05,999
u.
And, maybe I should also say in words, this

356
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:17,890
is the component of
the gradient in the direction of u.

357
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:24,039
And, maybe that makes more sense.
So, for example, the directional derivative

358
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,239
in
the direction of I hat is the component along

359
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,019
the x axes.
That's the same as, indeed, the partial derivatives

360
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:48,719
in the x direction. Things make sense.
dw/ds in the direction of I hat is, sorry,

361
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:55,029
gradient w dot I hat,
which is wx,maybe I should write, partial

362
00:42:55,029 --> 00:43:08,329
w of partial x.
OK, now, so that's basically what we need

363
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:12,029
to know to compute
these guys. So now, let's go back to the

364
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:28,690
gradient and see what this tells us about
the gradient.

365
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:52,719
[APPLAUSE] I see you guys are having fun.
OK, OK, let's do a little bit of geometry

366
00:43:52,719 --> 00:44:00,239
here.
That should calm you down. So, we said dw/ds

367
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,630
in the
direction of u is gradient w dot u.

368
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:11,269
That's the same as the length of gradient
w times the length

369
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:16,219
of u. Well, that happens to be one
because we are taking the unit vector times

370
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:25,839
the cosine of the
angle between the gradient and the given unit

371
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:35,299
vector,
u, so, have this angle, theta. OK, that's

372
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:38,259
another way of
saying we are taking the component of a gradient

373
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:43,249
in the
direction of u. But now, what does that tell

374
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:46,109
us?
Well, let's try to figure out in

375
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:52,809
which directions w changes the fastest,
in which direction it increases the most or

376
00:44:52,809 --> 00:45:03,119
decreases the most,
or doesn't actually change. So, when is this

377
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
going to be
the largest? If I fix a point,

378
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,619
if I set a point, then the gradient vector
at

379
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:12,410
that point is given to me. But, the question
is,

380
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,180
in which direction does it change the most
quickly?

381
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,930
Well, what I can change is the direction,
and this will be the

382
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:25,630
largest when the cosine is one. So, this is
largest when the

383
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:32,959
cosine of the angle is one. That means the
angle is zero.

384
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:38,890
That means u is actually in the direction
of the gradient.

385
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,479
OK, so that's a new way to think about the
direction of a

386
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:46,799
gradient. The gradient is the direction
in which the function increases the most quickly

387
00:45:46,799 --> 00:46:04,109
at that point.
So, the direction of gradient w is the direction

388
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:14,640
of fastest
increase of 
w at the given point.

389
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,599
And, what is the magnitude of w? Well, it's
actually the

390
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:34,950
directional derivative in that direction.
OK, so if I go in that direction, which gives

391
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,349
me the
fastest increase, then the corresponding slope

392
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:49,930
will be the length of the gradient.
And, with the direction of the fastest decrease?

393
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,579
It's going in the opposite direction, right?
I mean, if you are on a mountain, and you

394
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,380
know that you
are facing the mountain, that's the direction

395
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,039
of fastest
increase. The direction of fastest

396
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:12,239
decrease is behind you straight down.
OK, so, the minimal value of dw/ds is achieved

397
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,539
when cosine of
theta is minus one. That means theta equals

398
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:26,779
180�.
That means u is in the direction of minus

399
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:30,400
the gradient.
It points opposite to the gradient.

400
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:48,079
And, finally, when do we have dw/ds equals
zero? So, in which direction does the

401
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,309
function not change? Well, we have two answers
to

402
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:58,119
that. One is to just use the formula.
So, that's one cosine theta equals zero.

403
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,369
That means theta equals 90 degrees. That means
that u is

404
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:07,979
perpendicular to the gradient. The other way
to think about

405
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:11,269
it, the direction in which the value doesn't
change is a

406
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:15,459
direction that's tangent to the level surface.
If we are not changing a, it means we are

407
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,769
moving along
the level. And, that's the same thing --

408
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:35,089
-- 
as being tangent to the level.
So, let me just show that on the picture here.

409
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:39,430
So, if actually show you the gradient, you
can't really see

410
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:44,299
it here. I need to move it a bit.
So, the gradient here is pointing straight

411
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,799
up at the
point that I have chosen. Now, if I choose

412
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,140
a slice that's
perpendicular, and a direction that's

413
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,119
perpendicular to the gradient, so that's actually
tangent to

414
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,380
the level curve, then you see that my slice
is

415
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,349
flat. I don't actually have any slop.
The directional derivative in a direction

416
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:05,819
that's perpendicular
to the gradient is basically zero.

417
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:11,180
Now, if I rotate, then the slope sort of
increases, increases, increases, and it becomes

418
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,589
the
largest when I'm going in the direction of

419
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:17,539
a gradient.
So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.

420
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:20,219
And now, if I keep rotating, then the slope
will decrease

421
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:25,299
again. Then it becomes zero when I
perpendicular, and then it becomes negative.

422
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:28,849
It's the most negative when I pointing away
from the gradient

423
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:32,699
and then becomes zero again when I'm back
perpendicular.

424
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,699
OK, so for example, if I give you a contour
plot,

425
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:40,699
and I ask you to draw the direction of the
gradient

426
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:46,249
vector, well, at this point,
for example, you would look at the picture.

427
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,890
The gradient vector would be going perpendicular
to the

428
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:54,519
level. And, it would be going towards
higher values of a function. I don't know

429
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:57,069
if you can see the
labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.

430
00:49:57,069 --> 00:50:00,170
So, it will actually be pointing in this kind
of

431
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:07,629
direction. OK, so that's it for today.
