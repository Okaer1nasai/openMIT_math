6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:28,470
OK, so far we've learned how to do double
integrals in terms of

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,420
xy coordinates, also how to switch to polar
coordinates. But, more generally,

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,140
there's a lot of different changes of variables
that you

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,239
might want to do. OK, so today we're going
to see

10
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:57,649
how to change variables, if you want,
how to do substitutions in double integrals.

11
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:15,130
OK, so let me start with a simple example.
Let's say that we want to find the area of

12
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:28,780
an ellipse with
semi-axes a and b. OK, so that means an ellipse

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,420
is
just like a squished circle. And so, there's

14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,420
a and there's b.
And, the equation of that ellipse is x over

15
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,200
a squared plus
y over b squared equals one. That's the curve,

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,000
and the inside region is where this is less
than one.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,530
OK, so it's just like a circle that where
you have rescaled x

18
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,729
and y differently. So, let's say we want to
find

19
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,439
the area of it. Maybe you know what the area
is.

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:15,790
But let's do it as a double integral.
So, you know, if you find that the area is

21
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,480
too easy, you can integrate any function other
than ellipse,

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,230
if you prefer. But, let's do it just with
area.

23
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,840
So, we know that we want to integrate just
the area element,

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,670
let's say, dx dy over the origin inside the
ellipse.

25
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,830
That's x over a2 plus y over b2 less than
1.

26
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,349
Now, we can try to set this up in terms of
x and y coordinates,

27
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,120
you know, set up the bounds by solving for
first four x as a

28
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,409
function of y if we do it this order and,
well, do the usual stuff. That doesn't look

29
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,220
very
pleasant, and it's certainly not the best

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,690
way to do it.
OK, if this were a circle, we would switch

31
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,069
to polar
coordinates. Well, we can't quite do that

32
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,599
yet. But, you know,
an ellipse is just a squished circle.

33
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,569
So, maybe we want to actually first rescale
x and y by a and

34
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:18,810
b. So, to do that,
what we'd like to do is set x over a to be

35
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,650
u,
and y over b be v. So, we'll have two new

36
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,060
variables, u and v, and we'll try to redo
our

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,500
integral in terms of u and v. So, how do we
do the

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,830
substitution? So, in terms of u and v,
the condition, the region that we are

39
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,900
integrating on will become u^2 v^2 is less
than 1,

40
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,489
which is arguably nicer than the ellipse.
That's why we are doing it. But, we need to

41
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,569
know what to do
with dx and dy. Well, here, the answer is

42
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,180
pretty easy because we just change x and y
separately.

43
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:08,209
We do two independent substitutions.
OK, so if we set u equals x over a, that means

44
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:19,220
du is one
over adx. And here, dv is one over bdy.

45
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,510
So, it's very tempting to write, and here
we actually can

46
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,050
write, in this particular case, that dudv
is (1/ab)dxdy,

47
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:50,280
OK? So, let me rewrite that.
OK, so 
I get dudv equals (1/ab)dxdy, or equivalently

48
00:04:50,280 --> 00:05:01,220
dxdy
is ab times dudv. OK, so in my double integral,

49
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:15,860
I'm going to write (ab)dudv. OK, so now, my
double integral

50
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,640
becomes, well, the double integral of a
constant in terms of u and v. So, I can take

51
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,220
the constant out.
I will get ab times double integral over u^2

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,970
v^2<1 of du
dv. And, that is an integral that

53
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,190
we know how to do. Well, it's just the area
of a

54
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:48,550
unit circle. So, we can just say,
this is ab times the area of the unit disk,

55
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,820
which we know to be pi, or if somehow you
had some

56
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,830
function to integrate, then you could have
somehow

57
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,600
switched to polar coordinates, you know, setting
u equals r

58
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,490
times cos(theta), v equals r times sin(theta),
and then doing it in polar coordinates.

59
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,350
OK, so here the substitution worked pretty
easy.

60
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,410
The question is, if we do a change of variables
where the relation between x and y and u and

61
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,250
v is more
complicated, what can we do? Can we still

62
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,890
do this,
or do we have to be more careful?

63
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,120
And, actually, we have to be more careful.
So, that's what we are going to see next.

64
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:38,830
Any question about this, first? No?
OK. OK, so, see the general problem

65
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,030
when we try to do this is to figure out what
is the scale

66
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:53,830
factor? What's the relation between
dxdy and dudv? We need to find the scaling

67
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:10,800
factor. So, we need to find dxdy versus
dudv. So, let's do another example

68
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,720
that's still pretty easy, but a little bit
less easy.

69
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,550
OK, so let's say that for some reason, we
want to do the change

70
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:30,160
of variables: u equals 3x-2y,
and v equals x y. Why would we want to do

71
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,770
that?
Well, that might be to simplify the integrand

72
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,460
because we are
integrating a function that happens to be

73
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,880
actually involving
these guys rather than x and y. Or, it might

74
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,180
be to simplify the
bounds because maybe we are integrating over

75
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,180
a region whose
equation in xy coordinates is very hard to

76
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,990
write down.
But, it becomes much easier in terms of u

77
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,280
and v.
And then, the bounds would be much easier

78
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,690
to set up with u and
v. Anyway, so, whatever the reason

79
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:08,220
might be, typically it would be to simplify
the integrant or the

80
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:20,120
bounds. Well, how do we convert dxdy to
dudv? So, we want to understand,

81
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:28,250
what's the relation between, let's call dA
the area element

82
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,720
in xy coordinates. So, dA is dxdy,
maybe dydx depending on the order.

83
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,640
And, the area element in uv coordinates, let
me call that dA

84
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,370
prime just to make it look different.
So, that would just be dudv, or dvdu depending

85
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,410
on which
order I will want to set it up in.

86
00:08:47,410 --> 00:09:01,010
So, to find this relation, it's probably best
to draw a

87
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,530
picture to see what happens. Let's consider
a small piece of

88
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:15,010
the xy plane with area delta(A) corresponding
to just a box with

89
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:24,270
sides delta(y) and delta(x). OK, and let's
try to figure out

90
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,220
what it will look like in terms of u and v.
And then, we'll say, well, when we integrate,

91
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,510
we're really summing the value of the function
of a lot of

92
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,170
small boxes times their area. But, the problem
is that the

93
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,240
area of the box in here is not the same as
the area of the box

94
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,590
in uv coordinates. There, maybe it will look
like,

95
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,760
actually, if you see that these are
linear changes of variables, you know that

96
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,500
the rectangle
will become a parallelogram after the change

97
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,220
of variables.
So, the area of a parallelogram delta(A) prime,

98
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,010
well, we will have to figure out how they
are related so that

99
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:11,440
we can decide what conversion factor,
what's the exchange rate between these two

100
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,940
currencies for
area? OK, any questions at this point?

101
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:28,840
No? Still with me mostly? I see a lot of tired
faces.

102
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:37,800
Yes? Why is delta(A) prime a
parallelogram? That's a very good question.

103
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,080
Well, see, if I look at the side of a rectangle,
say there's a vertical side, it means I'm

104
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,150
going to increase
y, keeping x the same. If I look at the formulas

105
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,770
for u
and v, they are linear formulas in terms of

106
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,010
x and y.
So, if I just increase y, see that u is going

107
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,950
to decrease
at a rate of two. v is going to increase at

108
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,830
a
rate of one at constant rates. And, it doesn't

109
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,710
matter whether
I was looking at this site or at that site.

110
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,760
So, basically straight lines become straight
lines.

111
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,280
And if they are parallel, they stay parallel.
So, if you just look at what the transformation,

112
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,420
from xy to uv does, it does this kind of thing.
Actually, this transformation here you can

113
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,590
express by a
matrix. And, remember,

114
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,870
we've seen what matrices do the pictures.
We just take straight lines to straight lines.

115
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,410
They keep the notion of being parallel, but
of course they

116
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:36,690
mess up lengths, angles, and all that.
OK, so let's see. So, let's try to figure

117
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,650
out,
what is the area of this guy? Well, in fact,

118
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,300
what I've been saying about this transformation
being

119
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,050
linear, and transforming all of the
vertical lines in the same way, all the horizontal

120
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,680
lines in the
same way, it tells me,

121
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,779
also, I should have a constant scaling factor,
right, because how much I've scaled my rectangle

122
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,560
doesn't
depend on where my rectangle is. If I move

123
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,920
my rectangle to
somewhere else, I have a rectangle of the

124
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,680
same
size, same shape, it will become a parallelogram

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,300
of the same size, same shape somewhere else.
So, in fact, I can just take the simplest

126
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,680
rectangle I can think of and see how its area
changes.

127
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,310
And, if you don't believe me, then try with
any other

128
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,670
rectangle. You will see it works exactly
the same way. OK, so I claim that the area

129
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:38,750
scaling factor -- -- here in this case doesn't
depend on the

130
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:51,220
choice of the rectangle. And I should say
that because

131
00:12:51,220 --> 00:13:05,120
we are actually doing a linear change of variables
-- So,

132
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,950
you know, somehow, the exchange rate between
uv

133
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,020
and xy is going to be the same everywhere.
So, let's try to see what happens to the simplest

134
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,130
rectangle I can think of, namely, just the
unit square.

135
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:23,930
And, you know, if you don't trust me,
then while I'm doing this one, do it with

136
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,029
a different
rectangle. Do the same calculation,

137
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,180
and see that you will get the same conversion
ratio.

138
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:43,130
So, let's say that I take a unit square -- -- so,
something that goes from zero to one both

139
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,960
in x and y
directions. OK, and let's try to figure out

140
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,940
what it looks like on the other side.
So, here the area is one. Let's try to draw

141
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,700
it in terms
of u and v coordinates, OK?

142
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,380
So, here we have x equals 0, y equals 0.
Well, that tells us u and v are going to be

143
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:15,980
0.
Next, let's look at this corner. Well, in

144
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,310
xy coordinates,
this is one zero. If you plug x equals 1,

145
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:36,860
y equals 0, you get u equals 3; v equals 1.
So, that goes somewhere here. And so, this

146
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,480
edge of the square
will become this line here, OK?

147
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,990
Next, let's look at that point. So that point
here was (0,1).

148
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:58,310
If I plug x equals zero y equals one I will
get (-2,1).

149
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:10,860
So, this edge goes here. Then, if you put
x equals one,

150
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:20,690
y equals one, you will get u equals 1,
v equals 2. So, I want (1,2).

151
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:31,100
And, these edges will go to these edges here.
And, you see, it does look like a

152
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:42,320
parallelogram. OK, so now what the area of
this parallelogram? Well, we can get that

153
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,010
by taking
the determinant of these two vectors.

154
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:56,790
So, one of them is , and the other one is
. That will be 3 2.

155
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:03,960
That's 5. OK, this parallelogram is
apparently five times the size of this square.

156
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,870
Here, it looks like it's less because I somehow
changed my

157
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,000
scale. I mean, my unit length is
smaller here than here. But, it should be

158
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,310
a lot bigger
than that. OK,

159
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,149
and if you do the same calculations not with
zero and

160
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:22,920
one, but with x and x plus delta x,
and so on, you will still find that the

161
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:35,370
area has been multiplied by five.
So, that tells us, actually for any other

162
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:52,520
rectangle, area is also multiplied by five.
So, that tells us that dA prime, the area

163
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,220
element in uv
coordinate is worth five times more than the

164
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:10,030
area element in
the xy coordinate.

165
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,490
So, that means du dv is worth five times dx
dy.

166
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:31,470
What's so funny? What?
Oh. [LAUGHTER] OK, rectangle.

167
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:48,570
OK, is that OK now? Did I misspell other words?
No? OK, it's really hard to see

168
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,300
when you are up close. It's much easier from
a

169
00:17:50,300 --> 00:18:03,940
distance. OK, so yeah,
so we've said our transformation multiplies

170
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,300
areas
by five. And so, dudv is five times dxdy.

171
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:17,370
So, if I'm integrating some function, dx dy,
then when I switch to uv coordinates, I will

172
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:24,660
have to
replace that by one fifth dudv. OK, and of

173
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,740
course I would also,
here my function would probably involve x

174
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,370
and y.
I will replace them by u's and v's.

175
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,740
And, the bounds, well, the shape of my origin
in

176
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,870
the xy coordinates I will have to switch to
some shape in the

177
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,400
uv coordinates. And, that's also something
that

178
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,429
might be easy or might be tricky depending
on what origin we are

179
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:51,600
looking at. So, usually we will do changes
of variables to actually simplify the region

180
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,460
so it
becomes easier to set up the bounds.

181
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:05,390
So, anyway, so this is kind of an illustration
of a general

182
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,200
case. And, why is that?
Well, here it looks very easy. We are just

183
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,679
using linear
formulas, and somehow the relation between

184
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,679
dx dy and du dv
is the same everywhere. If you take actually

185
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,710
more
complicated changes of variables that's not

186
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,460
true because usually
you will expect that there are some places

187
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,890
where the rescaling
is enlarging things, and some of other places

188
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,780
where
things are shrunk, so, certainly the exchange

189
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,100
rate
between dudv and dxdy will fluctuate from

190
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,570
point to point.
It's the same as if you're trying to change

191
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,780
dollars to
euros. It depends on where you do it.

192
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:47,800
You will get a better rate or a worse one.
So, of course, we'll get a formula where

193
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,260
actually this scaling factor depends on x
and y or on u and

194
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,820
v. But, if you fix a point,
then we have linear approximation.

195
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,929
And, linear approximation tells us, oh, we
can do as if our

196
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:02,600
function is just a linear function of x and
y.

197
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
So then, we can do it the same way we did
here.

198
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:22,160
OK, so let's try to think about that.
So, in the general case, well, that means

199
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,860
we will
replace x and y by new coordinates, u and

200
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,799
v.
And, u and v will be some functions of x and

201
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,890
y.
So, well, we'll have an approximation

202
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,460
formula which tells us that the change in
u,

203
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,130
if I change x or y a little bit,
will be roughly (u sub x times change in x)

204
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,740
(u sub y times
change in y). And, the change in v will be

205
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:59,660
roughly (v sub x delta x) (v sub y delta y).
Or, the other way to say it, if you want in

206
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:06,420
matrix form is
delta u delta v is, sorry, approximately equal

207
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,790
to
matrix |u sub x, u sub y, v sub x,

208
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:26,809
v sub y| times matrix |delta x, delta y|,
OK? So, if we look at that,

209
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,720
what it tells us, in fact, is that if we take
a small

210
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,490
rectangle in xy coordinates, so that means
we have a certain

211
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:50,020
point, x, y, and then we have a certain
width. This is going to be too small.

212
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:59,730
Well, so, I have my width, delta x.
I have my height, delta y. This is going to

213
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:17,250
correspond to
a small uv parallelogram. And, what the shape

214
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,720
and the
size of the parallelogram are depends on the

215
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,460
partial
derivatives of u and v. So, in particular,

216
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,630
it depends on at which point we are.
But still, at a given point, it's a bit like

217
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:38,660
that.
And, so if we do the same argument as before,

218
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,010
what we will see is that the scaling factor
is actually the

219
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:49,580
determinant of this transformation.
So, that's one thing that maybe we didn't

220
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,210
emphasize enough when
we did matrices at the beginning of a semester.

221
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,720
But, when you have a linear transformation
between

222
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,390
variables, the determinant of that transformation
represents

223
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,340
how it scales areas. OK, so one way to think
about

224
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:12,140
it is just to try it and see what happens.
Take this side. This side in x,

225
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,230
y coordinates corresponds to delta x and zero.
And, now, if you take the image of that, if

226
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,360
you see what happens
to delta u and delta v, that will be basically

227
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,670
u sub x
delta x and v sub x delta x. There's no delta

228
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,830
y.
For the other side, OK, so maybe I should

229
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,260
do it
actually. So, you know,

230
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,220
if we move in the x, y coordinates by delta
x and

231
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:50,690
zero, then delta u and delta v will
be approximately u sub x delta x,

232
00:23:50,690 --> 00:24:04,030
and v sub x delta x. And, on the other hand,
if you move in the other direction along the

233
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,220
other side
of your rectangle, zero and delta y,

234
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,540
then the change in u and the change in v will
correspond to,

235
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,990
well, how does u change? That's u sub y delta
y,

236
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:21,620
and v changes by v sub y delta y.
And so, now, if you take the determinant of

237
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,980
these two vectors, OK, so these are the sides
of

238
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,350
your parallelogram up here. And, if you take
these sides to

239
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,580
get the area of the parallelogram,
you'll need to take the determinant.

240
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,090
And, the determinant will be the determinant
of this matrix

241
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:47,000
times delta x times delta y. So, the area
in uv coordinates

242
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,890
will be the determinant of a matrix times
delta x,

243
00:24:51,890 --> 00:25:01,770
delta y. And so,
what I'm trying to say is that when you have

244
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,230
a general change
of variables, du dv versus dx dy is given

245
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,000
by
the determinant of this matrix of partial

246
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,710
derivatives.
It doesn't matter in which order you write

247
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,809
it.
I mean, you can put in rows or columns.

248
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,590
If you transpose a matrix, that doesn't change
the

249
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:52,630
determinant. It's just any sensible matrix
that you can write will have the correct determinant.

250
00:25:52,630 --> 00:26:07,340
OK, so what we need to know is the following
thing.

251
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,750
So, we define something called the
Jacobian of a change of variables and used

252
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:22,910
the letter J,
or maybe a more useful notation is partial

253
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,840
of u,
v over partial of x, y.

254
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,950
That's a very strange notation. I mean, that
doesn't mean that

255
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,230
we are actually taking the partial derivatives
of anything.

256
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,230
OK, it's just a notation to remind us that
this has to do

257
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:41,679
with the ratio between dudv and dxdy.
And, it's obtained using the partial derivatives

258
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,669
of u and v
with respect to x and y. So, it's the determinant

259
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:54,580
of the
matrix |u sub x, u sub y, v sub x,

260
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:10,280
v sub y|, the matrix that I had up there.
OK, and what we need to know is that du dv

261
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,860
is equal to the
absolute value of J dx dy. Or, if you prefer

262
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,970
to see it in
the easier to remember version, it's (absolute

263
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:26,150
value of d of
(u, v) over partial xy) times dx dy.

264
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:37,010
OK, so this is just what you need to remember,
and it says that the area in uv coordinates

265
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,950
is worth,
well, the ratio to the xy coordinates is given

266
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,730
by this
Jacobian determinant except for one small

267
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,419
thing.
It's given by, actually, the absolute value

268
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:52,830
of
this guy. OK, so what's going on here?

269
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,270
What's going on here is when we are saying
the determinant of

270
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,120
the transformation tells us how the area is
multiplied,

271
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,179
there's a small catch. Remember, the determinants
are

272
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,010
equal to areas up to sine. Sometimes, the
determinant is

273
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,760
negative because of reversing the orientation
of things.

274
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,110
But, the area is still the same. Area is always
positive.

275
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,360
So, the area elements are actually related
by the absolute

276
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,059
value of this guy. OK, so if you find -10
as your

277
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:33,030
answer, then du dv is still ten times dx dy.
OK, so I didn't put it all together because

278
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,630
then you would
have two sets of vertical bars. See, this

279
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,480
is a vertical bar for
absolute value. This is vertical bar for

280
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,750
determinant. They're not the same.
That's the one thing to remember.

281
00:28:44,750 --> 00:29:07,280
OK, any questions about this? No?
OK. So, actually let's do our first

282
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,929
example of that. Let's check what we had for
polar coordinates. Last time I told you if

283
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:19,660
we have
dx dy we could switch it to r dr d theta.

284
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:25,380
And, we had some argument for that by looking
at the area of a

285
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,320
small circular sector. But, let's check again
using

286
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,100
this new method. So, in polar coordinates
I'm

287
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,520
setting x equals r cosine theta, y equals
r sine theta.

288
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:54,169
So, the Jacobian for this change of variables,
so let's say I'm trying to find the partial

289
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,330
derivatives of x,
y with respect to r, theta.

290
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:09,520
Well, what is, OK, let me actually write them
here again for you. And, so what does that

291
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:17,140
become?
Partial x over partial r is just cosine theta.

292
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,299
Partial x over partial theta is negative r
sine theta.

293
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:27,200
Sorry, I guess I'm going to run out of space
here.

294
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,850
So, let me do it underneath. So, we said x
sub r is cosine

295
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:41,350
theta; x sub theta is negative r sine
theta. y sub r is sine;

296
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:47,490
y sub theta is r cosine. And now, if we compute
this

297
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:58,710
determinant, we'll get (r cosine squared theta)
(r sine squared

298
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:08,490
theta). And, that simplifies to r.
So, dx dy is, well, absolute value of r dr

299
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,750
d
theta. But, remember that r is always

300
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:23,370
positive. So, it's r dr d theta.
OK, so that's another way to justify how we

301
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:31,080
did double
integrals in polar coordinates. OK, any questions

302
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:45,390
on that?
Where? Yeah, OK.

303
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:56,559
Yeah, so this one seems to be switching.
Well, it depends what you do. So, OK, actually

304
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,740
here's an
important thing that I didn't quite say.

305
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,100
So, I said, you know, we are going to switch
from xy

306
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,070
to uv. We can also switch from uv to
xy. And, this conversion ratio,

307
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:16,030
the Jacobian, works both ways.
Once you have found the ratio between du dv

308
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,330
and dx dy,
then it works one way or it works the other

309
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,640
way.
I mean, here, of course, we get the answer

310
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,440
in
terms of r. So, this would let us switch

311
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,720
from xy to r theta. But, we can also switch
from r

312
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,700
theta to xy. Just, we'd write dr d theta
equals (1 over r) times dx dy. And then we'd

313
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,580
have,
of course, to replace r by its formula in

314
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,610
xy coordinates.
Usually, we don't do that. Usually, we actually

315
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,789
start with
xy and switch to polar. But,

316
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:53,600
so in general, when you have this formula
relating du dv with dx dy, you can use it

317
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,900
both ways,
either to switch from du dv to dx dy or the

318
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,490
other way around.
And, the thing that I'm not telling you that

319
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,870
now I should
probably tell you is I could define two Jacobians

320
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:11,289
because if
I solve for xy in terms of uv instead of uv

321
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,350
in terms of xy,
then I can compute two different Jacobians.

322
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,950
I can compute partial uv over partial xy,
or I can compute

323
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,390
partial xy over partial uv if I have the formulas
both ways.

324
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,330
Well, the good news is these guys are the
inverse of each

325
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:45,480
other. So, the two formulas that you
might get are consistent.

326
00:33:45,480 --> 00:34:13,859
OK, so useful remark -- So, say that you can
compute both

327
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:25,609
-- -- 
these guys. Well, then actually,
the product will just be 1. So, they are the

328
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,819
inverse of
each other. So, it doesn't matter which one

329
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:33,419
you compute. You can compute whichever one
is the easiest to compute no matter which

330
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:49,069
one of the two you
need. And, one way to see that is

331
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:52,629
that, in fact, we're looking at the
determinant of these matrices that tell us

332
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:56,129
the relation in
variables. So, if one of them tells you

333
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,819
how delta u delta v relate to delta x delta
y,

334
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:02,329
the other one does the opposite thing.
It means they are the inverse matrices.

335
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:05,819
And, the determinant of the inverse matrix
is the inverse of

336
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:13,670
the determinant. So, they are really
interchangeable. I mean, you can just compute

337
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,940
whichever one is easiest. So here, if you
wanted,

338
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,950
dr d theta in terms of dx dy, it's easier
to do this and then

339
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,819
move the r over there than to first solve
for r and theta as

340
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:30,609
functions of x and y and then do the entire
thing again.

341
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:35,849
But, you can do it if you want. I mean, it
works.

342
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:45,200
Oh yeah, the other useful remark, so, I mentioned
it,

343
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,869
but let me emphasize again. So, now, the ratio
between du

344
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,019
dv and dx dy, it's not a constant anymore,
although there it used to be five.

345
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,839
But now, it's become r, or anything.
In general, it will be a function that depends

346
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,289
on the
variables. So, it's not true that you can

347
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:14,759
just say, oh, I'll put a constant times du
dv. Yes?

348
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:17,989
It would still work the same. You could imagine
drawing a

349
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,549
picture where r and theta are the Cartesian
coordinates,

350
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,719
and your picture would be completely messed
up.

351
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,160
It would be a very strange thing to do to
try to draw,

352
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,950
you know, I'm going to do it, but don't take
notes on that.

353
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,239
You could try to draw picture like that, and
then a circle

354
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,969
would start looking like, you know, a disk
would look

355
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:37,569
like that. It would be very
counterintuitive. But, you could do it.

356
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:40,309
And that would be equivalent to what we did
with a previous

357
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,369
change of variables. So, in this case,
certainly you would never draw a picture like

358
00:36:45,369 --> 00:37:00,309
that.
But, you could do it. OK, so now let's do

359
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,900
a complete
example to see how things fit together, how

360
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:10,509
we do everything.
So, let's say that we want to compute, so

361
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:12,789
I have to warn you,
it's going to be a very silly example.

362
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:15,589
It's an example where it's much easier to
compute things without

363
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:23,910
the change of variables. But, you know,
it's good practice in the sense that we're

364
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,900
going to make it so
complicated that if we can do this one, then

365
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,249
we can do that
one. So, let's say that we want to

366
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:35,269
compute this. And, of course,
it's very easy to compute it directly.

367
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:41,839
But let's say that for some evil reason we
want to do that

368
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,130
by changing variables to u equals x and v
equals xy.

369
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,099
OK, that's a very strange idea, but let's
do it anyway.

370
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,069
I mean, normally, you would only do this kind
of

371
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:01,019
substitution if either it simplifies a lot
the function

372
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,210
you are integrating, or it simplifies a lot
the

373
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:12,229
region on which you are integrating.
And here, neither happens. But anyway, so

374
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:15,029
the first thing
we have to do here is figure out what we are

375
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:18,579
going to be
integrating. OK, so to do that,

376
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:22,829
we should figure out what dx dy will become
in terms of u and v.

377
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:25,589
So, that's what we've just seen using the
Jacobian.

378
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:30,670
OK, so the first thing to do is find the area
element.

379
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:35,989
And, for that, we use the Jacobian.
So, well, let's see, the one that we can do

380
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:39,729
easily
is partials of u and v with respect to x and

381
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:41,539
y.
I mean, the other one is not very hard because

382
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:44,319
here you can
solve easily. But, the one that's given to

383
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:49,839
you is partial of u and v with respect to
x and y,

384
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,849
so partial u partial x is one. Partial u partial
y is zero.

385
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:01,640
Partial v partial x is y. And partial v partial
y is x.

386
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:16,719
So that's just x. So, that means that du dv
is x

387
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:23,529
dx dy. Well, it would be absolute
value of x, but x is positive in our origin.

388
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:31,489
So, at least we don't have to worry about
that.

389
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:40,960
OK, so now that we have that, we can try to
look at the

390
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:53,349
integrand in terms of u and v. OK, so we were
integrating x

391
00:39:53,349 --> 00:40:03,200
squared y dx dy. So, let's switch it.
Well, let's first switch the dx dy that becomes

392
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:13,979
one over x du
dv. So, that's actually xy du dv.

393
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:19,680
And, what is xy in terms of u and v?
Well, here at least we had a little bit of

394
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,989
luck.
xy is just v. So, that's v du dv.

395
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:32,589
So, in fact, what we'll be computing is a
double integral over some mysterious region

396
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:44,229
of v du dv.
Now, last but not least, we'll have to find

397
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:48,809
what are the
bounds for u and v in the new integral so

398
00:40:48,809 --> 00:41:13,709
that we know how to
evaluate this.

399
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,190
In fact, well, we could do it du dv or dv
du.

400
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:30,099
We don't know yet. Oh, amazing.
It went all the way down this time.

401
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:47,910
OK, so it could be dv du if that's easier.
So, let's try to find the bounds.

402
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:58,700
In this case, that's the hardest part.
OK, so let me draw a picture in xy coordinates

403
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,089
and try to
understand things using that. OK, so x and

404
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,229
y go from zero to
one. The region that we want to

405
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:16,099
integrate over was just this square.
Let's try to figure out how u and v vary there.

406
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:24,359
So, let's say that we're going to do it du
dv.

407
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:32,719
OK, so What we want to understand is how u
and v vary

408
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:39,180
in here. What's going to happen?
So, the way we can think about it is we try

409
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,130
to figure out how
we are slicing our origin. OK, so here,

410
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:48,259
we are integrating first over u.
That means we start by keeping u constant,

411
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:53,359
no,
by keeping v constant as u changes.

412
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:05,259
OK, so u changes as v is constant.
What does it mean that I'm keeping v constant.

413
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:13,719
Well, what is v? v is xy.
So, that means I keep xy equals constant.

414
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,950
What does the curve xy equals constant look
like?

415
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,269
Well, it's just a hyperbola. y equals constant
over x.

416
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:32,249
So, if I look at the various values of v that
I can take,

417
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:38,650
for each value of v, if I fix a value of v,
I will be moving on one of these red curves.

418
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:45,209
OK, and u, well, u is the same thing as x.
So, that means u will increase. Here, maybe

419
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:49,700
it will be 0.1 and
it will increase all the way to one here.

420
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,089
OK, so we are just traveling on each of these
slices.

421
00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:03,279
Now, so the question we must answer here is
for a given value

422
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:08,029
of v, what are the bounds for u? So, I'm traveling
on my curve,

423
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:14,309
v equals constant, and trying to figure out,
when do I enter my origin? When do I leave

424
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:17,319
it?
Well, I enter it when I go through this side.

425
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:22,479
So, the question is, what's the value of u
here?

426
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:28,900
Well, we don't know that very easily until
we look at these

427
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:35,109
formulas. So, u equals x,
OK, but we don't know what x is at that point.

428
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:41,269
v equals x and v equals xy. What do we go
here?

429
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:49,380
Well, we don't know x, but we know y certainly.
OK, so let's forget about trying to find u.

430
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,779
And, let's say, for now, we know y equals
one.

431
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:58,400
Well, if we set y equals one, that tells us
that u and v are

432
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:06,890
both equal to x. So, in terms of u and v,
the equation of this uv coordinate is u equals

433
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:13,759
v.
OK, I mean, the other way to do it is, say

434
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,410
that you know you
want y equals one. You want to know what is

435
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,959
y in
terms of u and v. Well, it's easy.

436
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:29,259
y is v over u. So, let me actually add an
extra step in case that's, so, we know that

437
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:35,700
y is v over u
equals one. So, that means u=v is my

438
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:42,729
equation. OK, so when I'm here,
when I'm entering my region, the value of

439
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:52,309
u at this point is
just v, u equals v. That's the hard part.

440
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,209
Now, we need to figure out, so, we started
u equals v.

441
00:45:56,209 --> 00:46:01,339
u increases, increases, increases.
Where does it exit? It exits one when we are

442
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,329
here.
What's the value of u here? One. That one

443
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:10,789
is easier, right?
This side here, so, this side here is x equals

444
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:18,229
one. That means u equals one.
So, we start at u equals one. Now, we've done

445
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:23,579
the inner
integral. What about the outer?

446
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,920
So, we have to figure out, what is the first
and what is

447
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,579
the last value of v that we'll want to consider?
Well, if you look at all these hyperbola's,

448
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:38,229
xy equals constant.
What's the smallest value of xy that we'll

449
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:41,450
ever want to look at
in here? Zero, OK.

450
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:55,099
Let me actually, where's my yellow chalk?
Is it, no, ah. So, this one here,

451
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:59,339
that's actually v=0. So, we'll start at v
equals

452
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,709
zero. And, what's the last hyperbola
we want to look at? Well, it's the one that's

453
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:07,430
right
there in the corner. It's this one here.

454
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:13,609
And, that's v equals one. So, v goes from
zero to one.

455
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:20,469
OK, and now, we can compute this.
I mean, it's not particularly easier than

456
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:25,259
that one,
but it's not harder either. How else could

457
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,630
we have gotten
these bounds, because that was quite evil.

458
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,900
So, I would like to recommend that you try
this way in case it

459
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,969
works well. Just try to picture,
what are the slices in terms of u and v, and

460
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:40,729
how you travel on
them, where you enter, where you leave,

461
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:45,059
staying in the xy picture. If that somehow
doesn't work

462
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:55,930
well, another way is to draw the picture in
the uv coordinates.

463
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:03,410
So, switch to a uv picture. So, what do I
mean by that?

464
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:08,609
Well, we had here a picture in xy coordinates
where we had our

465
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:14,380
sides. And, we are going to try to
draw what it looks like in terms of u and

466
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,369
v.
So, here we said this is x equals one.

467
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:24,969
That becomes u equals one. So, we'll draw
u equals one.

468
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:30,229
This side we said is y equals one becomes
u equals v.

469
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:38,749
That's what we've done over there.
OK, so u equals v. Now, we have the two other

470
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,949
sides to deal with. Well, let's look at this
one

471
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:46,249
first. So, that was x equals zero.
What happens when x equals zero? Well, both

472
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:49,759
u and v are zero.
So, this side actually gets squished in the

473
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:52,849
change of
variables. It's a bit strange,

474
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:55,469
but it's a bit the same thing as when you
switch to polar

475
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:59,469
coordinates at the origin, r is zero but theta
can be

476
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:07,920
anything. It's not always one point is
one point. So anyway, this is the origin,

477
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,989
and then the last side, y equals zero,
and x varies just becomes v equals zero.

478
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:20,099
So, somehow, in the change of variables,
this square becomes this triangle.

479
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:27,299
And now, if we want to integrate du dv,
it means we are going to slice by v equals

480
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:31,569
constant.
So, we are going to integrate over slices

481
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:35,329
like this,
and you see for each value of v, we go from

482
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:40,190
u equals v to u
equals one. And, v goes from zero to one.

483
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,920
OK, so you get the same bounds just by drawing
a different

484
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,170
picture. So, it's up to you to decide
whether you prefer to think on this picture

485
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,769
or draw that one
instead. It depends on which problems

486
00:49:52,769 --> 00:49:53,229
you're doing.
