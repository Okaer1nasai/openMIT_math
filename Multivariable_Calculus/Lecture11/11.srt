6
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:26,970
So far we have learned about partial derivatives
and how to

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,529
use them to find minima and maxima of functions
of two

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,980
variables or several variables. And now we
are going to try to

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,239
study, in more detail, how functions of several
variables behave, how to compete their

10
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,510
variations. How to estimate the variation
in arbitrary directions. And so for that we

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,750
are going to
need some more tools actually to study this

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:04,150
things.
More tools to study functions.

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:30,360
Today's topic is going to be differentials.
And, just to motivate that, let me remind

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,119
you about one
trick that you probably know from single variable

15
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:48,430
calculus,
namely implicit differentiation.

16
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,259
Let's say that you have a function y equals
f of x then

17
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:05,590
you would sometimes write dy equals f prime
of x times dx.

18
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:23,069
And then maybe you would -- 

19
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:30,900
We use implicit differentiation to
actually relate infinitesimal changes in y

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,769
with infinitesimal
changes in x. And one thing we can do with

21
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,769
that, for example, is actually figure out
the rate

22
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,480
of change dy by dx, but also the reciprocal
dx by

23
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:57,260
dy. And so, for example,
let's say that we have y equals inverse sin(x).

24
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:06,379
Then we can write x equals sin(y).
And, from there, we can actually find out

25
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,980
what
is the derivative of this function if we didn't

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,519
know the
answer already by writing dx equals cosine

27
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:25,180
y dy.
That tells us that dy over dx is going to

28
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,950
be one over cosine
y. And now cosine for relation to

29
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:40,120
sine is basically one over square root of
one minus x^2.

30
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,480
And that is how you find the formula for the
derivative of

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,030
the inverse sine function. A formula that
you probably

32
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:57,439
already knew, but that is one way to derive
it. Now we are going to use also

33
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,599
these kinds of notations, dx, dy and so on,
but use them for functions of several variables.

34
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,010
And, of course, we will have to learn what
the

35
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,000
rules of manipulation are and what we can
do with them.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:24,380
The actual name of that is the total differential,
as opposed to the partial derivatives.

37
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,720
The total differential includes all of the
various causes that

38
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,820
can change -- Sorry. All the contributions
that can

39
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:41,720
cause the value of your function f to change.
Namely, let's say that you have a function

40
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,550
maybe of three
variables, x, y, z,

41
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:55,070
then you would write df equals f sub x dx
plus f sub y dy plus

42
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:04,160
f sub z dz. Maybe, just to remind you of
the other notation, partial f over partial

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,290
x dx
plus partial f over partial y dy plus partial

44
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:18,640
f over partial z
dz. Now, what is this object?

45
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,810
What are the things on either side of this
equality?

46
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,510
Well, they are called differentials.
And they are not numbers, they are not vectors,

47
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,470
they are not matrices, they are a different
kind of

48
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,120
object. These things have their own
rules of manipulations, and we have to learn

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,150
what we
can do with them. So how do we think about

50
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:51,320
them?
First of all, how do we not think about them?

51
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:06,470
Here is an important thing to know.
Important. df is not the same thing as

52
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:14,520
delta f. That is meant to be a number.
It is going to be a number once you have a

53
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,420
small variation of x,
a small variation of y, a small variation

54
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,550
of z.
These are numbers. Delta x, delta y and delta

55
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,700
z
are actual numbers, and this becomes a number.

56
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,070
This guy actually is not a number.
You cannot give it a particular value.

57
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,690
All you can do with a differential is express
it in

58
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,730
terms of other differentials. In fact, this
dx,

59
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,330
dy and dz, well, they are mostly symbols out
there. But if you want to think about

60
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,460
them, they are the differentials of x, y and
z.

61
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,770
In fact, you can think of these differentials
as placeholders

62
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,550
where you will put other things. Of course,
they represent,

63
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,620
you know, there is this idea of changes in
x,

64
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,940
y, z and f. One way that one could explain
it, and I don't really like it, is to say

65
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,130
they represent
infinitesimal changes. Another way to say

66
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,620
it,
and I think that is probably closer to the

67
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,110
truth,
is that these things are somehow placeholders

68
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,650
to put
values and get a tangent approximation.

69
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,900
For example, if I do replace these symbols
by delta x, delta y and delta z numbers then

70
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,760
I will actually get
a numerical quantity. And that will be an

71
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,350
approximation formula for delta. It will be
the linear

72
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:50,590
approximation, a tangent plane approximation.
What we can do -- Well, let me start first

73
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:56,320
with maybe
something even before that. The first thing

74
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:05,020
that it does is
it can encode how changes in x, y, z affect

75
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:13,690
the value of f.
I would say that is the most general answer

76
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,550
to what is this
formula, what are these differentials.

77
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:30,860
It is a relation between x, y, z and f.
And this is a placeholder for small variations,

78
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:48,760
delta x, delta y and delta z to get an approximation
formula.

79
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:58,240
Which is delta f is approximately equal to
fx delta

80
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:09,620
x fy delta y fz delta z. It is getting cramped,
but I am sure you know what is going on here.

81
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,570
And observe how this one is actually equal
while that one is

82
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,940
approximately equal. So they are really not
the same.

83
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,090
Another thing that the notation suggests we
can do,

84
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,310
and they claim we can do, is divide everything
by some

85
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:32,720
variable that everybody depends on.
Say, for example, that x, y and z actually

86
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,420
depend
on some parameter t then they will vary, at

87
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,420
a certain rate,
dx over dt, dy over dt, dz over dt.

88
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,310
And what the differential will tell us then
is the rate of

89
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,260
change of f as a function of t, when you plug
in these values

90
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:05,320
of x, y, z, you will get df over dt by
dividing everything by dt in here.

91
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:22,150
The first thing we can do is divide by something
like dt to

92
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:34,460
get infinitesimal rate of change.
Well, let me just say rate of change.

93
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:53,200
df over dt equals f sub x dx over dt plus
f sub y dy over dt

94
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,110
plus f sub z dz over dt. And that corresponds
to the

95
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:10,450
situation where x is a function of t, y is
a function of t and z

96
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,260
is a function of t. That means you can plug
in

97
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,210
these values into f to get, well, the value
of f will

98
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:27,600
depend on t, and then you can find the rate
of change with t of a value of f.

99
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,910
These are the basic rules. And this is known
as the chain

100
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,790
rule. It is one instance of a chain
rule, which tells you when you have a

101
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,960
function that depends on something,
and that something in turn depends on something

102
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,160
else,
how to find the rate of change of a function

103
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,020
on the new
variable in terms of the derivatives of a

104
00:11:53,020 --> 00:12:01,500
function and
also the dependence between the various variables.

105
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,400
Any questions so far? No.
OK. A word of warming,

106
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,170
in particular, about what I said up here.
It is kind of unfortunate, but the textbook

107
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,279
actually has a
serious mistake on that. I mean they do have

108
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,770
a couple of
formulas where they mix a d with a delta,

109
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:32,110
and I warn you not to
do that, please. I mean there are d's and

110
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,670
there
are delta's, and basically they don't live

111
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:44,730
in the same world.
They don't see each other. The textbook is

112
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:59,640
lying to you.
Let's see. The first and the second

113
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,410
claims, I don't really need to justify
because the first one is just stating some

114
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,260
general principle,
but I am not making a precise mathematical

115
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,160
claim.
The second one, well, we know the approximation

116
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,550
formula already, so I don't need to justify
it

117
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,760
for you. But, on the other hand,
this formula here, I mean, you probably have

118
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,930
a
right to expect some reason for why this works.

119
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,330
Why is this valid? After all, I first told
you we

120
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,050
have these new mysterious objects.
And then I am telling you we can do that,

121
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:39,510
but I kind of
pulled it out of my hat. I mean I don't have

122
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:53,279
a hat.
Why is this valid? How can I get to this?

123
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:05,920
Here is a first attempt of justifying how
to get there.

124
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:19,320
Let's see. Well, we said df is f sub x dx
plus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz. But we know

125
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:33,880
if x is a function
of t then dx is x prime of t dt, dy is y prime

126
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:44,440
of t dt,
dz is z prime of t dt. If we plug these into

127
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:54,210
that
formula, we will get that df is f sub x times

128
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:05,050
x prime t dt plus
f sub y y prime of t dt plus f sub z z prime

129
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:13,920
of t dt.
And now I have a relation between df and dt.

130
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,200
See, I got df equals sometimes times dt.
That means the rate of change of f with respect

131
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:35,589
to t should be
that coefficient. If I divide by dt then I

132
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:46,810
get
the chain rule. That kind of works,

133
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,550
but that shouldn't be completely satisfactory.
Let's say that you are a true skeptic and

134
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,250
you don't believe in
differentials yet then it is maybe not very

135
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,160
good that I
actually used more of these differential notations

136
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,560
in
deriving the answer. That is actually not

137
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,830
how it is
proved. The way in which you prove the

138
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:14,420
chain rule is not this way because we shouldn't
have too

139
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,140
much trust in differentials just yet.
I mean at the end of today's lecture, yes,

140
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,700
probably we should believe in them,
but so far we should be a little bit reluctant

141
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,960
to believe
these kind of strange objects telling us weird

142
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:38,970
things.
Here is a better way to think about it.

143
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,870
One thing that we have trust in so far are
approximation

144
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:53,040
formulas. We should have trust in them.
We should believe that if we change x a little

145
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:02,480
bit,
if we change y a little bit then we are actually

146
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,809
going to
get a change in f that is approximately given

147
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,970
by these
guys. And this is true for any

148
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,160
changes in x, y, z,
but in particular let's look at the changes

149
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,410
that we get if we
just take these formulas as function of time

150
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:29,330
and change time
a little bit by delta t. We will actually

151
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:38,809
use the
changes in x, y, z in a small time delta t.

152
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:49,580
Let's divide everybody by delta t.
Here I am just dividing numbers so I am not

153
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,530
actually playing any
tricks on you. I mean we don't really know

154
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,500
what it means to divide differentials,
but dividing numbers is something we know.

155
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:10,660
And now, if I take delta t very small, this
guy tends to the

156
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:18,220
derivative, df over dt. Remember, the definition
of df

157
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,370
over dt is the limit of this ratio when the
time interval

158
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,850
delta t tends to zero. That means if I choose
smaller

159
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,490
and smaller values of delta t then these ratios
of numbers

160
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,900
will actually tend to some value,
and that value is the derivative.

161
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:47,110
Similarly, here delta x over delta t, when
delta t is really

162
00:18:47,110 --> 00:19:18,380
small, will tend to the derivative dx/dt.
And similarly for the others.

163
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:28,080
That means, in particular, we take the limit
as delta t

164
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,190
tends to zero and we get df over dt on one
side and on the other

165
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:41,160
side we get f sub x dx over dt plus f sub
y dy over dt plus f

166
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,780
sub z dz over dt. And the approximation becomes
better and better. Remember when we write

167
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,410
approximately equal that means it is not quite
the same,

168
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,790
but if we take smaller variations then actually
we will

169
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,790
end up with values that are closer and closer.
When we take the limit, as delta t tends to

170
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:21,059
zero,
eventually we get an equality.

171
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,130
I mean mathematicians have more complicated
words to justify

172
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,309
this statement. I will spare them for now,
and you will see them when you take analysis

173
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:41,420
if you go in that
direction. Any questions so far?

174
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,740
No. OK.
Let's check this with an example.

175
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,900
Let's say that we really don't have any faith
in these things

176
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:05,140
so let's try to do it. Let's say I give you
a function

177
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,890
that is x ^2 y z. And let's say that maybe
x will

178
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:36,240
be t, y will be e^t and z will be sin(t).
What does the chain rule say? Well, the chain

179
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:48,000
rule tells us
that dw/dt is, we start with partial w over

180
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,850
partial x, well, what is that?
That is 2xy, and maybe I should point out

181
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:08,630
that this is w sub x, times dx over dt plus
-- Well,

182
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:20,530
w sub y is x squared times dy over dt plus
w sub z,

183
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:31,600
which is going to be just one, dz over dt.
And so now let's plug in the actual values

184
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,530
of these things.
x is t and y is e^t, so that will be 2t e

185
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:47,380
to the t,
dx over dt is one plus x squared is t squared,

186
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:59,929
dy over dt is e over t, plus dz over dt is
cosine t.

187
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,870
At the end of calculation we get 2t e to the
t plus t squared

188
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,880
e to the t plus cosine t. That is what the
chain rule

189
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,540
tells us. How else could we find that?
Well, we could just plug in values of x, y

190
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,679
and z,
x plus w is a function of t, and take its

191
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,390
derivative.
Let's do that just for verification.

192
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,910
It should be exactly the same answer.
And, in fact, in this case,

193
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,720
the two calculations are roughly equal in
complication.

194
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,290
But say that your function of x, y, z was
much more

195
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,580
complicated than that, or maybe you actually
didn't

196
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,340
know a formula for it, you only knew its partial
derivatives, then you would need to use the

197
00:23:47,340 --> 00:24:12,980
chain rule. So, sometimes plugging in
values is easier but not always.

198
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,200
Let's just check quickly. The other method
would be to

199
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:34,540
substitute. W as a function of t.
Remember w was x^2y z. x was t, so you get

200
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,559
t squared,
y is e to the t, plus z was sine t.

201
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:47,559
dw over dt, we know how to take the derivative
using single

202
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,059
variable calculus. Well, we should know.
If we don't know then we should take a look

203
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:58,410
at 18.01 again.
The product rule that will be derivative of

204
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:04,240
t squared is 2t
times e to the t plus t squared time the derivative

205
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:12,919
of e to the
t is e to the t plus cosine t. And that is

206
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:19,260
the same answer as
over there. I ended up writing,

207
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,350
you know, maybe I wrote slightly more here,
but actually the amount of calculations really

208
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:33,440
was pretty
much the same. Any questions about that?

209
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:43,679
Yes? What kind of object is w?
Well, you can think of w as just another variable

210
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,230
that is
given as a function of x, y and z, for example.

211
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,720
You would have a function of x, y, z defined
by this formula,

212
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,559
and I call it w. I call its value w so that
I

213
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:05,710
can substitute t instead of x, y, z.
Well, let's think of w as a function of three

214
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,690
variables.
And then, when I plug in the dependents of

215
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,600
these three
variables on t, then it becomes just a function

216
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:23,450
of t. I mean, really,
my w here is pretty much what I called f before.

217
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:37,630
There is no major difference between the two.
Any other questions? No.

218
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:49,140
OK. Let's see.
Here is an application of what we have seen.

219
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,820
Let's say that you want to understand actually
all these

220
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,010
rules about taking derivatives in single variable
calculus.

221
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,400
What I showed you at the beginning, and then
erased,

222
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,210
basically justifies how to take the derivative
of a reciprocal

223
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,880
function. And for that you didn't need
multivariable calculus. But let's try to justify

224
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,270
the
product rule, for example,

225
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:16,760
for the derivative. An application of this
actually

226
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:32,630
is to justify the product and quotient rules.
Let's think, for example,

227
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,620
of a function of two variables, u and v, that
is just the

228
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:47,650
product uv. And let's say that u and v are
actually functions of one variable t.

229
00:27:47,650 --> 00:28:00,610
Then, well, d of uv over dt is given by the
chain rule applied

230
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:10,179
to f. This is df over dt.
So df over dt should be f sub q du over dt

231
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:18,990
plus f sub v plus dv
over dt. But now what is the partial of

232
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:27,320
f with respect to u? It is v.
That is v du over dt. And partial of f with

233
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:38,309
respect
to v is going to be just u, dv over dt.

234
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:44,990
So you get back the usual product rule.
That is a slightly complicated way of deriving

235
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,250
it,
but that is a valid way of understanding how

236
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,679
to take the
derivative of a product by thinking of the

237
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,500
product first as
a function of variables, which are u and v.

238
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,910
And then say, oh, but u and v were actually
functions of a variable t. And then you do

239
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,289
the
differentiation in two stages using the chain

240
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:13,840
rule.
Similarly, you can do the quotient rule just

241
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,429
for practice.
If I give you the function g equals u of v.

242
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,140
Right now I am thinking of it as a function
of two variables,

243
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:38,480
u and v. U and v themselves are actually
going to be functions of t. Then, well, dg

244
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,010
over dt is going
to be partial g, partial u.

245
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:52,919
How much is that? How much is partial g,
partial u? One over v times du over dt

246
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,160
plus -- Well, next we need to have partial
g

247
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,940
over partial v. Well, what is the derivative
of

248
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,870
this with respect to v? Here we need to know
how to

249
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:09,090
differentiate the inverse. It is minus u over
v squared

250
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:17,049
times dv over dt. And that is actually the
usual

251
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:27,890
quotient rule just written in a slightly different
way.

252
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,510
I mean, just in case you really want to see
it,

253
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,419
if you clear denominators for v squared then
you will see

254
00:30:35,419 --> 00:31:25,890
basically u prime times v minus v prime times
u.

255
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:45,360
Now let's go to something even more crazy.
I claim we can do chain rules with more variables.

256
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:53,500
Let's say that I have a quantity.
Let's call it w for now. Let's say I have

257
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,990
quantity w as
a function of say variables x and y.

258
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,289
And so in the previous setup x and y depended
on some

259
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:06,710
parameters t. But, actually,
let's now look at the case where x and y themselves

260
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,840
are
functions of several variables. Let's say

261
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:24,240
of two more variables.
Let's call them u and v. 

262
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,270
I am going to stay with these
abstract letters, but if it bothers you,

263
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,100
if it sounds completely unmotivated think
about it maybe

264
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,520
in terms of something you might now.
Say, polar coordinates. Let's say that I have

265
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,700
a
function but is defined in terms of the polar

266
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,909
coordinate
variables on theta. And then I know I want

267
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,280
to
switch to usual coordinates x and y.

268
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,720
Or, the other way around, I have a function
of x and y

269
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,100
and I want to express it in terms of the polar
coordinates r

270
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:59,760
and theta. Then I would want to know maybe
how the derivatives, with respect to the various

271
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:09,970
sets of variables, related to each other.
One way I could do it is, of course,

272
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:16,380
to say now if I plug the formula for x and
the formula

273
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,830
for y into the formula for f then w becomes
a function of u

274
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,070
and v, and it can try to take partial
derivatives. If I have explicit formulas,

275
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,549
well, that could work. But maybe the formulas
are

276
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,640
complicated. Typically, if I switch between
rectangular and polar coordinates,

277
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,000
there might be inverse trig, there might be
maybe arctangent

278
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,640
to express the polar angle in terms of x and
y.

279
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,360
And when I don't really want to actually substitute
arctangents

280
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:56,150
everywhere, maybe I would rather deal with
the derivatives.

281
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:11,219
How do I do that? The question is what are
partial w over partial u and partial w over

282
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:18,589
partial v in
terms of, let's see, what do we need to know

283
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,429
to
understand that? Well, probably we should

284
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,499
know
how w depends on x and y. If we don't know

285
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:30,349
that then we
are probably toast. Partial w over partial

286
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:36,129
x,
partial w over partial y should be required.

287
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,269
What else should we know? Well, it would probably
help to

288
00:34:38,269 --> 00:34:43,259
know how x and y depend on u and v.
If we don't know that then we don't really

289
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:56,429
know how to do it.
We need also x sub u, x sub v, y sub u,

290
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:04,359
y sub v. We have a lot of partials in
there. Well, let's see how we can do

291
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:18,499
that. Let's start by writing dw.
We know that dw is partial f, well, I don't

292
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:22,739
know why I have
two names, w and f. I mean w and f are really

293
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,450
the
same thing here, but let's say f sub x dx

294
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:34,390
plus f
sub y dy. So far that is our new friend,

295
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,989
the differential. Now what do we want to do
with

296
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:45,729
it? Well, we would like to get rid
of dx and dy because we like to express things

297
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,440
in terms of,
you know, the question we are asking ourselves

298
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,960
is let's say
that I change u a little bit, how does w change?

299
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,809
Of course, what happens, if I change u a little
bit,

300
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:06,210
is y and y will change. How do they change?
Well, that is given to me by the differential.

301
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:18,569
dx is going to be, well, I can use the
differential again. Well, x is a function

302
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:23,229
of u and
v. That will be x sub u times du

303
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:30,549
plus x sub v times dv. That is, again,
taking the differential of a function of two

304
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:35,089
variables.
Does that make sense? And then we have the

305
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:39,029
other guy,
f sub y times, what is dy?

306
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:49,719
Well, similarly dy is y sub u du plus y sub
v dv.

307
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,589
And now we have a relation between dw and
du and dv.

308
00:36:54,589 --> 00:37:00,239
We are expressing how w reacts to changes
in u and v,

309
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,940
which was our goal. Now, let's actually collect
terms so that we see it a bit better.

310
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:15,440
It is going to be f sub x times x sub u times
f sub y times y

311
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:24,819
sub u du plus f sub x, x sub v plus f sub
y y sub v

312
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:38,109
dv. Now we have dw equals something
du plus something dv. Well, the coefficient

313
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,170
here has
to be partial f over partial u. What else

314
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:47,809
could it be?
That's the rate of change of w with respect

315
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:52,229
to u if I forget
what happens when I change v. That is the

316
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:58,239
definition of a
partial. Similarly, this one has to be

317
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,109
partial f over partial v. That is because
it is the rate

318
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:13,440
of change with respect to v, if I keep u constant,
so that these guys are completely ignored.

319
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,359
Now you see how the total differential accounts
for,

320
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,549
somehow, all the partial derivatives that
come as

321
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:27,269
coefficients of the individual variables in
these expressions.

322
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,920
Let me maybe rewrite these formulas in a more
visible way

323
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:40,719
and then re-explain them to you. Here is the
chain rule for this

324
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,069
situation, with two intermediate variables
and two variables that

325
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:55,049
you express these in terms of. In our setting,
we get partial f over partial u equals partial

326
00:38:55,049 --> 00:39:00,930
f over partial x
time partial x over partial u plus partial

327
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:07,380
f over partial y
times partial y over partial u. And the other

328
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,989
one,
the same thing with v instead of u,

329
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:19,900
partial f over partial x times partial x over
partial v plus

330
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:27,930
partial f over partial u partial y over partial
v.

331
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,259
I have to explain various things about these
formulas

332
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:37,119
because they look complicated. And, actually,
they are not that complicated. A couple of

333
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,499
things to know.
The first thing, how do we remember a formula

334
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:46,969
like that? Well, that is easy.
We want to know how f depends on u.

335
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:51,319
Well, what does f depend on? It depends on
x and y.

336
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:55,960
So we will put partial f over partial x and
partial f over

337
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,259
partial y. Now, x and y, why are they here?
Well, they are here because they actually

338
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,269
depend on u as
well. How does x depend on u?

339
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:06,279
Well, the answer is partial x over partial
u.

340
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,849
How does y depend on u? The answer is partial
y over

341
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:14,900
partial u. See, the structure of this
formula is simple. To find the partial of

342
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,950
f with
respect to some new variable you use the partials

343
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,049
with respect to
the variables that f was initially defined

344
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:27,349
in terms of x
and y. And you multiply them by the

345
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,700
partials of x and y in terms of the new variable
that you want

346
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:40,069
to look at, v here, and you sum these things
together. That is the structure of the

347
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:43,979
formula. Why does it work?
Well, let me explain it to you in a slightly

348
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:48,739
different
language. This asks us how does f change

349
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:54,109
if I change u a little bit? Well, why would
f change if u

350
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,900
changes a little bit? Well, it would change
because f

351
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,839
actually depends on x and y and x and y depend
on u.

352
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,039
If I change u, how quickly does x change?
Well, the answer is partial x over partial

353
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,029
u.
And now, if I change x at this rate, how does

354
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,049
that have to
change? Well, the answer is partial f

355
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:17,089
over partial x times this guy. Well, at the
same time,

356
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:20,599
y is also changing. How fast is y changing
if I

357
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,819
change u? Well, at the rate of partial y
over partial u. But now if I change this how

358
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:33,269
does f change? Well, the rate of change is
partial f over partial y. The product is the

359
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:37,269
effect of
how you change it, changing u, and therefore

360
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:43,079
changing f. Now, what happens in real life,
if I change u a little bit? Well, both x and

361
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,640
y change at
the same time. So how does f change?

362
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:54,440
Well, it is the sum of the two effects.
Does that make sense? Good.

363
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,950
Of course, if f depends on more variables
then you just have

364
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:05,009
more terms in here. OK.
Here is another thing that may be a little

365
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,719
bit confusing.
What is tempting? Well, what is tempting here

366
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:11,119
would be to simplify these formulas by removing
these

367
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,489
partial x's. Let's simplify by partial x.
Let's simplify by partial y. We get partial

368
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:19,799
f over partial u
equals partial f over partial u plus partial

369
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:25,369
f over partial u.
Something is not working properly.

370
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:28,859
Why doesn't it work? The answer is precisely
because

371
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,789
these are partial derivatives. These are not
total derivatives.

372
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:38,089
And so you cannot simplify them in that way.
And that is actually the reason why we use

373
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,039
this curly d rather
than a straight d. It is to remind us,

374
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,940
beware, there are these simplifications that
we can do

375
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,109
with straight d's that are not legal here.
Somehow, when you have a partial derivative,

376
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:59,469
you must resist the urge of simplifying things.
No simplifications in here. That is the simplest

377
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:10,049
formula
you can get. Any questions at this point?

378
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:23,059
No. Yes?
When would you use this and what does it describe?

379
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,019
Well, it is basically when you have a function
given in terms

380
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:30,069
of a certain set of variables because maybe
there is a simply

381
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:34,589
expression in terms of those variables.
But ultimately what you care about is not

382
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:38,400
those variables,
z and y, but another set of variables, here

383
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,209
u and v.
So x and y are giving you a nice formula for

384
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,339
f,
but actually the relevant variables for your

385
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:48,049
problem are u
and v. And you know x and y are

386
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:52,039
related to u and v. So, of course,
what you could do is plug the formulas the

387
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:55,170
way that we did
substituting. But maybe that will give you

388
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,869
very complicated expressions. And maybe it
is actually easier

389
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,119
to just work with the derivates. The important
claim here is

390
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:05,009
basically we don't need to know the actual
formulas.

391
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,769
All we need to know are the rate of changes.
If we know all these rates of change then

392
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:12,940
we know how to take
these derivatives without actually having

393
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:19,759
to plug in
values. Yes?

394
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:26,150
Yes, you could certain do the same things
in terms of t.

395
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,079
If x and y were functions of t instead of
being functions of u

396
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,910
and v then it would be the same thing.
And you would have the same formulas that

397
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,759
I had,
well, over there I still have it.

398
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:41,390
Why does that one have straight d's?
Well, the answer is I could put curly d's

399
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,869
if I wanted,
but I end up with a function of a single variable.

400
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:49,190
If you have a single variable then the partial,
with respect to that variable, is the same

401
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,569
thing as the usual
derivative. We don't actually need to worry

402
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:56,670
about curly in that case. But that one is
indeed special

403
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,150
case of this one where instead of x and y
depending on two

404
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,440
variables, u and v, they depend on a single
variable t. Now, of course,

405
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:12,279
you can call variables any name you want.
It doesn't matter. This is just a slight

406
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:15,529
generalization of that. Well, not quite because
here I

407
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:19,559
also had a z. See, I am trying to just
confuse you by giving you functions that depend

408
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,180
on various
numbers of variables. If you have a function

409
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,249
of 30
variables, things work the same way, just

410
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:28,229
longer,
and you are going to run out of letters in

411
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:38,599
the alphabet before
the end. Any other questions?

412
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:51,190
No. What?
Yes? If u and v themselves depended

413
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,269
on another variable then you would continue
with your chain

414
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:59,839
rules. Maybe you would know to express
partial x over partial u in terms using that

415
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,039
chain rule.
Sorry. If u and v are dependent on yet

416
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:06,319
another variable then you could get the derivative
with respect

417
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,269
to that using first the chain rule to pass
from u v to that

418
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:15,859
new variable, and then you would plug in
these formulas for partials of f with respect

419
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,729
to u and v.
In fact, if you have several substitutions

420
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,950
to do,
you can always arrange to use one chain rule

421
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,009
at a time.
You just have to do them in sequence.

422
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:27,729
That's why we don't actually learn that, but
you can just do

423
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:31,269
it be repeating the process. I mean, probably
at that stage,

424
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:33,509
the easiest to not get confused actually is
to manipulate

425
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:47,079
differentials because that is probably easier.
Yes? Curly f does not exist.

426
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:52,259
That's easy. Curly f makes no sense by
itself. It doesn't exist alone.

427
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:57,880
What exists is only curly df over curly d
some variable.

428
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,930
And then that accounts only for the rate of
change with respect

429
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:08,130
to that variable leaving the others fixed,
while straight df is somehow a total variation

430
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,229
of f.
It accounts for all of the partial derivatives

431
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:23,539
and their
combined effects. OK. Any more questions?

432
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:27,709
No.
Let me just finish up very quickly by telling

433
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:32,410
you again one
example where completely you might want to

434
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,329
do this.
You have a function that you want to switch

435
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:45,479
between
rectangular and polar coordinates.

436
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:54,619
To make things a little bit concrete.
If you have polar coordinates that means in

437
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:59,900
the plane,
instead of using x and y, you will use coordinates

438
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,109
r,
distance to the origin, and theta, the angles

439
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:06,859
from the
x-axis. The change of variables for

440
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:14,279
that is x equals r cosine theta and y equals
r sine theta.

441
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:24,299
And so that means if you have a function f
that depends on x and

442
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:28,940
y, in fact, you can plug these in as a function
of r and theta.

443
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,949
Then you can ask yourself, well, what is partial
f over

444
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:40,809
partial r? And that is going to be,
well, you want to take partial f over partial

445
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:47,199
x times partial x
partial r plus partial f over partial y times

446
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,420
partial y over
partial r. That will end up being actually

447
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:59,739
f sub x times cosine theta plus f sub y times
sine theta.

448
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,920
And you can do the same thing to find partial
f,

449
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,209
partial theta. And so you can express
derivatives either in terms of x, y or in

450
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:13,109
terms of r and theta
with simple relations between them.

451
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:22,799
And the one last thing I should say.
On Thursday we will learn about more tricks

452
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:26,380
we can play with
variations of functions. And one that is important,

453
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,170
because you need to know it actually to do
the p-set,

454
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:38,749
is the gradient vector. The gradient vector
is simply a

455
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:43,930
vector. You use this downward pointing
triangle as the notation for the gradient.

456
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,279
It is simply is a vector whose components
are the partial

457
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:53,880
derivatives of a function. I mean, in a way,
you can think of a differential as a way to

458
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,390
package partial
derivatives together into some weird object.

459
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,199
Well, the gradient is also a way to package
partials

460
