6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:29,880
OK, so we're going to continue looking at
what happens when we

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:42,960
have non-independent variables. So, I'm afraid
we don't take

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:01:03,120
deliveries during class time, sorry.
Please take a seat, thanks. [LAUGHTER]

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:16,530
[APPLAUSE] OK, so Jason,
you please claim your package at the end of

10
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,399
lecture.
OK, so last time we saw how to use

11
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,189
Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum or
maximum of a function

12
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,619
of several variables when the variables are
not independent.

13
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,020
And, today we're going to try to figure out
more about

14
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,340
relations between the variables, and how to
handle functions

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,200
that depend on several variables when they're
related.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,799
So, just to give you an example,
in physics, very often, you have functions

17
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,189
that depend
on pressure, volume, and temperature where

18
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,959
pressure,
volume, and temperature are actually

19
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,929
not independent. But they are related,
say, by PV=nRT. So, of course,

20
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,459
then you can substitute and expressed a function
in terms of

21
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,819
two of them only, but very often it's convenient
to keep all three. But then we have to figure

22
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,830
out,
what are the rates of change with respect

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,570
to t,
with respect to each other, the rate of change

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,310
of f with
respect to these variables, and so on.

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,300
So, we have to figure out what we mean by
partial derivatives

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:30,830
again. So,
OK, more generally, let's say just for the

27
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,490
sake of
notation, I'm going to think of a

28
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:39,590
function of three variables, x, y, z,
where the variables are related by some equation,

29
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,140
but I will put in the form g of x, y, z equals
some constant.

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,260
OK, so that's the same kind of setup as we
had last time,

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,330
except now we are not just looking for minima
and maxima.

32
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:05,410
We are trying to understand partial derivatives.
So, the first observation is that if x, y,

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,460
and z are related, then that means,
in principle, we could solve for one of them,

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,170
and express it as a function of the two others.
So, in particular, can we understand even

35
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,450
without
solving? Maybe we can not solve.

36
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,610
Can we understand how the variables are related
to each

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:32,600
other? So, for example,
z, you can think of z as a function of x and

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,420
y.
So, we can ask ourselves, what are the rates

39
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,720
of change of
z with respect to x, keeping y constant,

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:51,690
or with respect to y keeping x constant?
And, of course, if we can solve,

41
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,819
that we know the formula for this.
And then we can compute these guys.

42
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:03,890
But, what if we can't solve? So, how do we
find these things

43
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:18,370
without solving? Well, so let's do an example.
Let's say that my relation is x^2 yz z^3=8.

44
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,550
And, let's say that I'm looking near the point
(x,

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:31,000
y, z) equals (2,3, 1).
So, let me check 2^2 plus three times one

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,350
plus 1^3 is indeed
eight. OK, but now,

47
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,980
if I change x and y a little bit, how does
z change?

48
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,260
Well, of course I could solve for z in here.
It's a cubic equation. There is actually a

49
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,760
formula.
But that formula is quite complicated.

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:58,650
We actually don't want to do that.
There's an easier way. So, how can we do it?

51
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:08,970
Well, let's look at the differential -- -- of
this

52
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,400
constraint quantity. OK, so if we called this
g,

53
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,930
let's look at dg. So, what's the differential
of

54
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:32,110
this? So, the differential of x^2 is
2x dx plus, I think there's a zdy.

55
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:41,370
There's a ydz, and there's also a 3z^2 dz.
OK, you can get this either by implicit differentiation

56
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,290
and the
product rule, or you could get this just by

57
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,460
putting here, here,
and here the partial derivatives of this with

58
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,510
respect
to x, y, and z. OK, any questions about how

59
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,580
I
got this? No?

60
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,540
OK. So, now, what do I do with this?
Well, this represents, somehow, variations

61
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,169
of g.
But, well, I've set this thing equal to eight.

62
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:22,020
And, eight is a constant. So, it doesn't change.
So, in fact, well, we can set this to zero

63
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:38,919
because, well, they call this g.
Then, g equals eight is constant.

64
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:48,470
That means we set dg equal to zero.
OK, so, now let's just plug in some values

65
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:56,840
at this point.
That tells us, well, so if x equals two,

66
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:07,020
that's 4dx plus z is one. So, dy plus y 3z^2
should be

67
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:16,270
6dz equals zero. And now, this equation,
here, tells us about a relation between the

68
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,470
changes in x,
y, and z near that point. It tells us how

69
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,260
you change x
and y, well, how z will change. Or, it tells

70
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,360
you actually
anything you might want to know about the

71
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,120
relations between
these variables so, for example,

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,040
you can move dz to that side, and then express
dz in terms of

73
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,949
dx and dy. Or, you can move dy to that
side and express dy in terms of dx and dz,

74
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,040
and so on.
It tells you at the level of the derivatives

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,870
how each of the
variables depends on the two others.

76
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:58,080
OK, so, just to clarify this: if we want to
view z as a

77
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,759
function of x and y, then what we will do
is we will

78
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:10,650
just move the dz's to the other side,
and it will tell us dz equals minus one over

79
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:20,570
six times 4dx
plus dy. And, so that should tell you

80
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:26,500
that partial z over partial x is minus four
over six.

81
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,870
Well, that's minus two thirds, and partial
z over partial y is

82
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:41,510
going to be minus one sixth. OK, another way
to think about

83
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,690
this: when we compute partial z over partial
x,

84
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:54,560
that means that actually we keep y constant.
OK, let me actually add some subtitles here.

85
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,540
So, here that means we keep y constant.
And so, if we keep y constant, another way

86
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,430
to think about it
is we set dy to zero. We set dy equals zero.

87
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,510
So if we do that, we get dx equals negative
four

88
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:21,410
sixths dx. That tells us the rate of
change of z with respect to x. Here, we set

89
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,930
x constant.
So, that means we set dx equal to zero.

90
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,700
And, if we set dx equal to zero, then we have
dz equals

91
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,140
negative one sixth of dy. That tells us the
rate of

92
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:43,899
change of z with respect to y. OK, any questions
about that?

93
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:59,580
No? What, yes?
Yes, OK, let me explain that again.

94
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,700
So we found an expression for dz in terms
of dx and dy.

95
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,130
That means that this thing, the differential,
is the total differential of z viewed as a

96
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,660
function of x and y.
OK, and so the coefficients of dx and dy are

97
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,010
the partials.
Or, another way to think about it, if you

98
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,070
want to know partial
z partial x, it means you set y to be constant.

99
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,670
Setting y to be constant means that you will
put zero in the

100
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:33,000
place of dy. So, you will be left with dz
equals minus four sixths dx. And, that will

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,380
give you the
rate of change of z with respect to x when

102
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:43,300
you keep y constant,
OK? So, there are various ways to

103
00:10:43,300 --> 00:11:01,540
think about this, but hopefully it makes sense.
OK, so how do we think about this in general?

104
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:11,810
Well, if we know that g of x, y, z equals
a constant,

105
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:27,470
then dg, which is gxdx gydy gzdz should be
set equal to

106
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:35,860
zero. OK, and now we can solve for
whichever variable we want to express in terms

107
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,520
of the others.
So, for example, if we care about z as a

108
00:11:41,520 --> 00:12:00,810
function of x and y -- -- we'll get that dz
is negative gx over

109
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:15,680
gz dx minus gy over gz dy. And, so if we want
partial z

110
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,200
over partial x, well, so one way is just to
say

111
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,910
that's going to be the coefficient of dx in
here,

112
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,750
or just to write down the other way.
We are setting y equals constant.

113
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:46,140
So, that means we set dy equal to zero.
And then, we get dz equals negative gx over

114
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,740
gz dx.
So, that means partial z over partial x is

115
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,160
minus gx over gz.
And, see, that's a very counterintuitive

116
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,410
formula because you have this minus sign that
you somehow

117
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,870
probably couldn't have seen come if you hadn't
actually derived

118
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:13,029
things this way. I mean, it's pretty surprising
to see that minus sign come out of nowhere

119
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:22,230
the first time you
see it. OK, so now we know how to find

120
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,870
the rate of change of constrained variables
with

121
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,290
respect to each other. You can apply the same
to find,

122
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,450
if you want partial x, partial y, or any of
them,

123
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:49,230
you can do it. Any questions so far?
No? OK, so, before we proceed

124
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,290
further, I should probably expose some problem
with the

125
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:02,350
notations that we have so far. So, let me
try to get you a bit

126
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,769
confused, OK? So, let's take a very simple
example. Let's say I have a function,

127
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,660
f of x, y equals x y. OK, so far it doesn't
sound

128
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,839
very confusing. And then, I can write partial
f

129
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,269
over partial x. And, I think you all know
how

130
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:34,269
to compute it. It's going to be just one.
OK, so far we are pretty happy. Now let's

131
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:44,149
do a change of
variables. Let's set x=u and y=u v.

132
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:53,050
It's not very complicated change of variables.
But let's do it. Then, f in terms of u and

133
00:14:53,050 --> 00:15:01,910
v,
well, so f, remember f was x y becomes u plus

134
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,910
u plus v.
That's twice u plus v. What's partial f over

135
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:18,550
partial u?
It's two. So, x and u are the same thing.

136
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,709
Partial f over partial x, and partial f over
partial u,

137
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:28,230
well, unless you believe that one equals two,
they are really not the same thing, OK?

138
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,570
So, that's an interesting, slightly strange
phenomenon.

139
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:40,970
x equals u, but partial f partial x is not
the same as

140
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:51,440
partial f partial u. So, how do we get rid
of this

141
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,149
contradiction? Well, we have to think a bit
more about what these notations mean, OK?

142
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:05,459
So, when we write partial f over partial x,
it means that we are varying x, keeping y

143
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,970
constant.
When we write partial f over partial u, it

144
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,769
means we are
varying u, keeping v constant. So, varying

145
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,050
u or varying x is
the same thing. But, keeping v constant,

146
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:24,730
or keeping y constant are not the same thing.
If I keep y constant, then when I change x,

147
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,500
so when I change u, then v will also have
to change

148
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,709
so that their sum stays the same.
Or, if you prefer the other way around, when

149
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,620
I do this one I
keep v constant. If I keep v constant and

150
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,420
I
change u, then y will change. It won't be

151
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,930
constant.
So, that means, well, life looked quite nice

152
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,540
and easy with these notations. But, what's
dangerous about

153
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,420
them is they are not making explicit what
it is exactly that

154
00:16:51,420 --> 00:17:04,140
we are keeping constant. OK, so just to write
things,

155
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,480
so here we change u and x that are the same
thing.

156
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:16,510
But we keep y constant, while here we change
u,

157
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:24,730
which is still the same thing as x.
But, what we keep constant is v, or in terms

158
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,730
of x and y,
that's y minus x constant. And, that's why

159
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,429
they are not
the same. So, whenever there's any risk

160
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,700
of confusion, OK, so not in the cases that
we

161
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,530
had before because what we've done until now,
we didn't really have a problem. But, in a

162
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,990
situation like this,
to clarify things, we'll actually say explicitly

163
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:07,179
what it is that we want to keep constant.
OK, so what's going to be our new notation?

164
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:13,730
Well, so it's not particularly pleasant because
it uses,

165
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,900
now, a subscript not to indicate what you
are

166
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,100
differentiating, but rather what you were
holding constant. So, that's quite a conflict

167
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,120
of
notation with what we had before.

168
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,960
I think I can safely blame it on physicists
or chemists.

169
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:41,429
OK, so this one means we keep y constant,
and partial f over

170
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:53,580
partial u with v held constant, similarly.
OK, so now what happens is we no longer have

171
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,400
any
contradiction. We have partial f over partial

172
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:06,840
x with y constant is different from partial
f over partial x

173
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,690
with v constant, which is the same as partial
f

174
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,870
over partial u with v constant. OK, so this
guy is one.

175
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:26,570
And these guys are two. So, now we can safely
use the

176
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,750
fact that x equals u if we are keeping track
of what is

177
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,750
actually held constant, OK?
So now, that's going to be particularly important

178
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,179
when we
have variables that are related because,

179
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,919
let's say now that I have a function that
depends on x,

180
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:54,000
y, and z. But, x, y, and z are related.
Then, it means that I look at, say, x and

181
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,910
y as my independent
variables, and z as a function of x and y.

182
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,700
Then, it means that when I do partials, say,
with respect to x, I will hold y constant.

183
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,620
But, I will let z vary as a function of x
and y.

184
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:12,880
Or, I could do it the other way around.
I could vary x, keep z constant,

185
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,900
and let y be a function of x and z.
And so, I will need to use this kind of notation

186
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:31,660
to indicate
which one I mean. OK, any questions?

187
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:41,460
No? All right, so let's try to do
an example where we have a function that depends

188
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,150
on
variables that are related. OK, so I don't

189
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,070
want to do one
with PV=nRT because probably, I mean, if you've

190
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,160
seen it,
then you've seen too much of it.

191
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,960
And, if you haven't seen it, then maybe it's
not the best

192
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:10,049
example. So, let's do a geometric
example. So, let's look at the area of

193
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:19,200
the triangle. So, let's say I have a
triangle, and my variables will be the sides

194
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,049
a and b.
And the angle here, theta. OK, so what's the

195
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,520
area of this
triangle? Well, its base times height

196
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:37,799
over two. So, it's one half of the base
is a, and the height is b sine theta.

197
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:47,220
OK, so that's a function of a, b, and theta.
Now, let's say, actually, there is a relation

198
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,780
between a, b, and theta that I didn't tell
you about, namely, actually,

199
00:21:51,780 --> 00:22:04,669
I want to assume that it's a right triangle,
OK? So, let's now assume it's a

200
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:13,809
right triangle with, let's say, the hypotenuse
is b.

201
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:22,330
So, we have the right angle here, actually.
So, a is here. b is here. Theta is here.

202
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,720
So, saying it's a right triangle is the same
thing as

203
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:35,390
saying that b equals sine theta, OK?
So that's our constraint. That's the relation

204
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:43,860
between a,
b, and theta. And, this is a function of a,

205
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:52,020
b, and theta. And, let's say that we want
to

206
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,230
understand how the area depends on theta.
OK, what's the rate of change of the area

207
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,450
of this triangle
with respect to theta? So, I claim there's

208
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,070
various
answers. I can think of at least three

209
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:47,280
possible answers.
So, what can we possibly mean by the rate

210
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:56,220
of change of A with
respect to theta? So, these are all things

211
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,490
that
we might want to call partial A partial theta.

212
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:06,530
But of course, we'll have to actually use
different notations to distinguish them.

213
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:12,330
So, the first way that we actually already
know about is

214
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,919
if we just forget about the fact that the
variables are related,

215
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,919
OK? So, if we just think of little
a, b, and theta as independent

216
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:47,669
variables, and we just change theta,
keeping a and b constant -- So, that's exactly

217
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:51,070
what we meant by
partial A, partial theta, right?

218
00:24:51,070 --> 00:25:01,990
I'm not putting any constraints. So, just
to use some new

219
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,159
notation, that would be the rate of change
of A with respect to

220
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,990
theta, keeping a and b fixed at the same time.
Of course, if we are keeping a and b fixed,

221
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,470
and we are changing
theta, it means we completely ignore this

222
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,490
property of being a
right triangle. So, in fact,

223
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,100
it corresponds to changing the area by changing
the angle,

224
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:27,850
keeping these lengths fixed. And, of course,
we lose the right angle. When we rotate this

225
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,169
side here,
but the angle doesn't stay at a right angle.

226
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:37,880
And that one, we know how to compute,
right, because it's the one we've been computing

227
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,809
all along.
So, that means we keep a and b fixed.

228
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:52,980
And then, so let's see, what's the derivatives
of A

229
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,950
with respect to theta? It's one half ab cosine
theta.

230
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:13,559
OK, now that one we know. Any questions?
No? OK, the two other guys will be

231
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:22,380
more interesting. So far, I'm not really doing
anything with my constraint. Let's say that

232
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,539
actually I do
want to keep the right angle. Then, when I

233
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:31,490
change theta,
there's two options. One is I keep a constant,

234
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,710
and then of course b will have to change because
if this width

235
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:40,240
stays the same, then when I change theta,
the height increases, and then this side length

236
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,710
increases. The other option is to change
the angle, keeping b constant. So, actually,

237
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,350
this side stays the same length.
But then, a has to become a bit shorter.

238
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,059
And, of course, the area will change in
different ways depending on what I do.

239
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:04,270
So, that's why I said we have three different
answers.

240
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:11,250
So, the next one is keep, I forgot which one
I said

241
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:26,580
first. Let's say keep a constant.
And, that means that b will change.

242
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,200
b is going to be some function of a and theta.
Well, in fact here, we know what the function

243
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,990
is
because we can solve the constraint, namely,

244
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,840
b is a over cosine theta. But we don't actually
need to

245
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:54,779
know that so that the triangle, so that the
right angle,

246
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:02,960
so that we keep a right angle. And, so the
name we will have

247
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,870
for this is partial a over partial theta with
a held

248
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:15,980
constant, OK? And, the fact that I'm not
putting b in my subscript there means that

249
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,650
actually b will be a
dependent variable. It changes in whatever

250
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,960
way it
has to change so that when theta changes,

251
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,640
a stays the same while
b changes so that we keep a right triangle.

252
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:46,230
And, the third guy is the one where we actually
keep b

253
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:53,970
constant, and now a,
we think a as a function of b and theta,

254
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,090
and it changes so that we keep the right angle.
So actually as a function of b and theta,

255
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,460
it's given over
there. A equals b cosine theta.

256
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,669
And so, this guy is called partial a over
partial theta

257
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:18,840
with b held constant. OK, so we've just defined
them.

258
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,970
We don't know yet how to compute these things.
That's what we're going to do now.

259
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,260
That is the definition, and what these things
mean.

260
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:41,720
Is that clear to everyone? Yes, OK.
Yes? OK, so the second answer,

261
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,520
again, so one way to ask ourselves,
how does the area depend on theta,

262
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,970
is to say, well, actually look at the area
of

263
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,970
the right triangle as a function of a and
theta only by solving

264
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:06,200
for b. And then, we'll change theta,
keep a constant, and ask, how does the area

265
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,289
change? So, when we do that,
when we change theta and keep a the same,

266
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:14,110
then b has to change so that it stays a right
triangle,

267
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:22,110
right, so that this relation still holds.
That requires us to change b. So, when we

268
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,620
write partial a
over partial theta with a constant, it means

269
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,169
that,
actually, b will be the dependent variable.

270
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,940
It depends on a and theta. And so, the area
depends on

271
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:42,470
theta, not only because theta is in the formula,
but also because b changes, and b is in the

272
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:53,200
formula.
Yes? No, no, we don't keep theta

273
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,640
constant. We vary theta, right?
The goal is to see how things change when

274
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,559
I change theta by a
little bit. OK, so if I change theta a

275
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,399
little bit in this one, if I change theta
a little bit

276
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,370
and I keep a the same, then b has to change
also in

277
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:14,230
some way. There's a right triangle.
And then, because theta and b change, that

278
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,600
causes the area to
change. OK, so maybe I should

279
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:29,710
re-explain that again. So, theta changes.
A is constant. But, we have the constraint,

280
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:37,220
a equals be plus sine theta. That means that
b changes.

281
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:46,059
And then, the question is, how does A change?
Well, it will change in part because theta

282
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,710
changes,
and in part because b changes. But, we want

283
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:58,059
to know how it
depends on theta in this situation.

284
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:07,590
Yes? Ah, that's a very good question.
So, what about, I don't keep a and b constant?

285
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,029
Well, then there's too many choices.
So I have to decide actually how I'm going

286
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,500
to change things.
See, if I just say I have this relation, that

287
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,950
means I have two
independent variables left, whichever two

288
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,210
of the three I
want. But, I still have to specify

289
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,440
two of them to say exactly which triangle
I mean.

290
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,789
So, I cannot ask myself just how will it change
if I change

291
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:35,700
theta and do random things with a and b?
It depends what I do with a and b.

292
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,840
Of course, I could choose to change them simultaneously,
but then I have to specify how exactly I'm

293
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,429
going to do that.
Ah, yes, if you wanted to, indeed, we could

294
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:51,909
also change
things in such a way that the third side remains

295
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:55,070
constant.
And that would be, yet, a different way to

296
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,890
attack
the problem. I mean, we don't have good

297
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,980
notation for this, here, because we didn't
give it

298
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,919
a name. But, yeah, I mean, we could.
We could call this guy c, and then we'd have

299
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,840
a different
formula, and so on. So, I mean, I'm not looking

300
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,760
at
it for simplicity. But, you could have many

301
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,669
more.
I mean, in general, you will want,

302
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:23,750
once you have a set of nice, natural variables,
you will want to look mostly at situations

303
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,909
where one of the
variables changes. Some of them are held fixed,

304
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,919
and then some dependent variable does whatever
it must

305
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:39,480
so that the constraint keeps holding.
OK, so let's try to compute one of them.

306
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,440
Let's say I decide that we will compute this
one.

307
00:33:43,440 --> 00:34:00,110
OK, let's see how we can compute partial a,
partial theta with a held fixed.

308
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:33,679
[APPLAUSE] OK, so let's try to compute
partial A, partial theta with a held constant.

309
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,859
So, let's see three different ways of doing
that.

310
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:49,639
So, let me start with method zero.
OK, it's not a real method. That's why I'm

311
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,190
not getting a
positive number. So, that one is just,

312
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,709
we solve for b, and we remove b from the
formulas. OK, so here it works well

313
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:05,680
because we know how to solve for b.
But I'm not considering this to be a real

314
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,579
method because in
general we don't know how to do that.

315
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,369
I mean, in the beginning I had this relation
that was an

316
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,799
equation of degree three. You don't really
want to solve

317
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:30,160
your equation for the dependent variable usually.
Here, we can. So, solve for b and substitute.

318
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,979
So, how do we do that? Well, the constraint
is a=b

319
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:48,640
cosine theta. That means b is a over cosine
theta. Some of you know that as a

320
00:35:48,640 --> 00:36:00,119
secan theta. That's the same.
And now, if we express the area in terms of

321
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:09,950
a and theta only,
A is one half of ab cosine, sorry, ab sine

322
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:19,569
theta is now one
half of a^2 sine theta over cosine theta.

323
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:27,569
Or, if you prefer, one half of a^2 tangent
theta.

324
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,499
Well, now that it's only a function of a and
theta,

325
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:35,579
I know what it means to take the partial derivative
with

326
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:51,700
respect to theta, keeping a constant.
I know how to do it. So, partial A over partial

327
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,529
theta, a held constant,
well, if a is a constant, then I get this

328
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:02,209
one half a^2
coming out times, what's the derivative of

329
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:11,079
tangent? Secan squared, very good.
If you're European and you've never heard

330
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,459
of secan,
that's one over cosine. And, if you know the

331
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:17,619
derivative
as one plus tangent squared, that's the same

332
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,680
thing.
And, it's also correct. OK, so, that's one

333
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,479
way of doing
it. But, as I've already said,

334
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:29,650
it doesn't get us very far if we don't know
how to solve for

335
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:35,660
b. We really used the fact that we
could solve for b and get rid of it.

336
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:49,249
So, there's two systematic methods, and let's
say the basic

337
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:52,140
rule is that you should give both of them
a chance.

338
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,469
You should see which one you prefer, and you
should be able

339
00:37:55,469 --> 00:38:01,670
to use one or the other on the exam.
OK, most likely you'll actually have a choice

340
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,900
between one or the
other. It will be up to you to decide

341
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,479
which one you want to use. But, you cannot
use solving in

342
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:18,769
substitution. That's not fair.
OK, so the first one is to use differentials.

343
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:29,349
By the way, in the notes they are called also
method one and

344
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,859
method two. I'm not promising that I have
the same one, am I? I mean, I might have one

345
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:38,420
and two switched.
It doesn't really matter. So, how do we do

346
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,690
things using
differentials? Well, first,

347
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:51,459
we know that we want to keep a fixed, and
that means that we'll

348
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:58,799
set da equal to zero, OK?
The second thing that we want to do is we

349
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:04,599
want to look at the
constraint. The constraint is a equals b

350
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,650
cosine theta. And, we want to differentiate
that. Well, differentiate the

351
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:17,059
left-hand side. You get da.
And, differentiate the right-hand side as

352
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:20,029
a function of
b and theta. You should get,

353
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:22,900
well, how many db's? Well, that's the rate
of change

354
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,979
with respect to b. That's cosine theta db
minus b

355
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:33,519
sine theta d theta. That's a product rule
applied

356
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:50,989
to b times cosine theta. So -- Well, now,
if we have a constraint that's relating da,

357
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,940
db,
and d theta, OK, so that's actually what we

358
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,369
did, right, that's the same sort of thing
as what we did at the beginning when we related

359
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:02,180
dx,
dy, and dz. That's really the same thing,

360
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,859
except now are variables are a, b, and theta.
Now, we know that also we are keeping a fixed.

361
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:15,859
So actually, we set this equal to zero.
So, we have zero equals da equals cosine theta

362
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:21,910
db minus b
sine theta d theta. That means that actually

363
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:29,289
we
know how to solve for db. OK, so cosine theta

364
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:40,519
db equals b
sine theta d theta or db is b tangent theta

365
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:46,999
d theta.
OK, so in fact, what we found,

366
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:52,769
if you want, is the rate of change of b with
respect to theta. Why do we care?

367
00:40:52,769 --> 00:41:00,339
Well, we care because let's look, now, at
dA,

368
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:09,640
the function that we want to look at.
OK, so the function is A equals one half ab

369
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,739
sine theta.
Well, then, dA, so we had to use the product

370
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:20,209
rule carefully, or we use the partials.
So, the coefficient of d little a will be

371
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:24,289
partial with respect
to little a. That's one half b sine theta

372
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:31,920
da
plus coefficient of db will be one half a

373
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:41,069
sine theta db plus
coefficient of d theta will be one half ab

374
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:48,849
cosine theta d
theta. But now, what do I do with that?

375
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:56,319
Well, first I said a is constant.
So, da is zero. Second, well,

376
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,920
actually we don't like b at all, right?
We want to view a as a function of theta.

377
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,940
So, well, maybe we actually want to use this
formula for db

378
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:17,789
that we found in here. OK, and then we'll
be left only

379
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:59,420
with d thetas, which is what we want.
So, if we plug this one into that one, we

380
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:11,140
get da equals one
half a sine theta times b tangent theta d

381
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:23,039
theta plus one
half ab cosine theta d theta. And, if we collect

382
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:29,349
these things
together, we get one half of ab times sine

383
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:40,150
theta times tangent
theta plus cosine theta d theta. And, if you

384
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,630
know your trig,
but you'll see that this is sine squared over

385
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,989
cosine plus
cosine squared over cosine. That's the same

386
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:52,299
as secan theta.
So, now you have expressed da as something

387
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:58,759
times d theta.
Well, that coefficient is the rate of change

388
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:03,209
of A with respect
to theta with the understanding that we are

389
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:09,719
keeping a fixed,
and letting b vary as a dependent variable.

390
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:28,329
Not enough space: sorry.
OK, in case it's clearer for you, let's think

391
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,920
about it
backwards. So, we wanted to find how A

392
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,400
changes. To find how A changes,
we write da. But now, this tells us how A

393
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,449
depends on little a, little b, and theta.
Well, we know actually we want to keep little

394
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:49,430
a constant.
So, we set this to be zero. Theta, well,

395
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,809
we are very happy because we want to express
things in terms

396
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:59,440
of theta. Db we want to get rid of.
How do we get rid of db? Well, we do that

397
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,630
by figuring
out how b depends on theta when a is fixed.

398
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:11,069
And, we do that by differentiating the constraint
equation, and setting da equal to zero.

399
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:30,390
OK, so -- I guess to summarize the method,
we wrote dA in terms

400
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:40,660
of da, db, d theta. Then, we say that a is
constant

401
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,859
means we set da equals zero. And, the third
thing is that

402
00:45:46,859 --> 00:46:05,640
because, well, we differentiate the
constraint. And, we can solve for db in

403
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:30,759
terms of d theta. And then, we plug into dA,
and we get the answer. OK, oops.

404
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:39,039
So, here's another method to do the same thing
differently is to

405
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,009
use the chain rule. So, we can use the chain
rule

406
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:47,180
with dependent variables, OK?
So, what does the chain rule tell us?

407
00:46:47,180 --> 00:47:00,839
The chain rule tells us, so we will want to
differentiate -- -- the formula for a with

408
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:07,469
respect to theta
holding a constant. So, I claim,

409
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:15,109
well, what does the chain rule tell us?
It tells us that, well, when we change things,

410
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:23,519
a changes because of the changes in the variables.
So, part of it is that A depends on theta

411
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,609
and theta
changes. How fast does theta change?

412
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:30,799
Well, you could call that the rate of change
of theta with

413
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:34,799
respect to theta with a constant.
But of course, how fast does theta depend

414
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:37,309
to
itself? The answer is one.

415
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:44,640
So, that's pretty easy. Plus, then we have
the partial

416
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,469
derivative, formal partial derivative, of
A with respect to

417
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:54,650
little a times the rate of change of a in
our situation.

418
00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:07,789
Well, how does little a change if a is constant?
Well, it doesn't change. And then, there is

419
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:13,619
Ab,
the formal partial derivative times, sorry,

420
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,939
the rate of change of b. OK, and how do we
find this one?

421
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:29,579
Well, here we have to use the constraint.
OK, and we can find this one from the constraint

422
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,170
as we've
seen at the beginning either by differentiating

423
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,709
the constraint,
or by using the chain rule on the constraint.

424
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:39,029
So, of course the calculations are exactly
the same.

425
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:43,380
See, this is the same formula as the one over
there,

426
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,910
just dividing everything by partial theta
and with

427
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:53,289
subscripts little a. But, if it's easier to
think

428
00:48:53,289 --> 00:49:03,069
about it this way, then that's also valid.
OK, so tomorrow we are going to review for

429
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:05,799
the test,
so I'm going to tell you a bit more about

430
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:08,289
this also as we go
over one practice problem on that.
