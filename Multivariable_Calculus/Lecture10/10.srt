6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:28,289
So, today we are going to continue looking
at critical

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,309
points, and we'll learn how to actually
decide whether a typical point is a minimum,

8
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,219
maximum, or a saddle point. So, that's the
main topic for

9
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:47,469
today. So, remember yesterday,
we looked at critical points of functions

10
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:54,609
of several variables.
And, so a critical point functions, we have

11
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:03,370
two values,
x and y. That's a point where the

12
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:14,040
partial derivatives are both zero.
And, we've seen that there's various kinds

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,950
of critical
points. There's local minima.

14
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,320
So, maybe I should show the function on this
contour

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,420
plot,there is local maxima, which are like
that.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,130
And, there's saddle points which are neither
minima nor

17
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,700
maxima. And, of course,
if you have a real function, then it would

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,969
be more
complicated. It will have several critical

19
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:52,469
points. So, this example here,
well, you see on the plot that there is two

20
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:58,189
maxima.
And, there is in the middle, between them,

21
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,009
a saddle point. And, actually,
you can see them on the contour plot.

22
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,950
On the contour plot, you see the maxima because
the

23
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,629
level curves become circles that now down
and shrink to the

24
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,129
maximum. And, you can see the saddle
point because here you have this level curve

25
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,370
that makes a figure
eight. It crosses itself.

26
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,150
And, if you move up or down here, so along
the y direction,

27
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,069
the values of the function will decrease.
Along the x direction, the values will increase.

28
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,450
So, you can see usually quite easily where
are the critical

29
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,159
points just by looking either at the graph
or at the contour

30
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:46,459
plots. So, the only thing with the
contour plots is you need to read the values

31
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,300
to tell a
minimum from a maximum because the contour

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,519
plots look the same.
Just, of course, in one case,

33
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:06,750
the values increase, and in another one they
decrease. So, the question -- -- is,

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:21,580
how do we decide -- -- 
between the various possibilities?
So, local minimum, local maximum,

35
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:43,769
or saddle point.
So, and, in fact, why do we care?

36
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:53,319
Well, the other question is how do we find
the global

37
00:03:53,319 --> 00:04:04,819
minimum/maximum of a function? So, here what
I should point

38
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,680
out, well, first of all,
to decide where the function is the largest,

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,819
in general you'll have actually to compare
the values.

40
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,690
For example, here, if you want to know,
what is the maximum of this function?

41
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,420
Well, we have two obvious candidates.
We have this local maximum and that local

42
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,440
maximum.
And, the question is, which one is the higher

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,110
of the
two? Well, in this case,

44
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,390
actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.
But, in general, you would have to compute

45
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,260
the
function at both points, and compare the values

46
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,040
if you
know that it's three at one of them and four

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,490
at the other.
Well, four wins. The other thing that you

48
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,360
see
here is if you are looking for the minimum

49
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,530
of this function,
well, the minimum is not going to be at any

50
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,470
of the critical
points. So, where's the minimum?

51
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,300
Well, it looks like the minimum is actually
out there on the

52
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,780
boundary or at infinity. So, that's another
feature.

53
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,480
The global minimum or maximum doesn't have
to be at a critical

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,300
point. It could also be,
somehow, on the side in some limiting situation

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,950
where one
variable stops being in the allowed rang of

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,820
values or goes
to infinity. So, we have to actually check

57
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,890
the boundary and the infinity behavior of
our function to know

58
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:24,420
where, actually, the minimum and maximum will
be. So, in general,

59
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:32,240
I should point out, these should occur either
at

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:45,690
the critical point or on the boundary or at
infinity.

61
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:55,800
So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a
domain of definition that we are considering.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,660
And so, we have to try both. OK, but so we'll
get back to

63
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,300
that. For now, let's try to focus on
the question of, you know, what's the type

64
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:14,340
of
the critical point? So, we'll use something

65
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,930
that's
known as the second derivative test.

66
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,300
And, in principle, well, the idea is kind
of

67
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,140
similar to what you do with the function of
one variable,

68
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,350
namely, the function of one variable.
If the derivative is zero, then you know that

69
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,880
you should
look at the second derivative. And, that will

70
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,120
tell you whether
it's curving up or down whether you have a

71
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,660
local max and the
local min. And, the main problem here is,

72
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,390
of course, we have more possible situations,
and we have several derivatives.

73
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,480
So, we have to think a bit harder about how
we'll decide.

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:59,800
But, it will again involve the second derivative.
OK, so let's start with just an easy example

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,980
that will be useful
to us because actually it will provide the

76
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,800
basis for the
general method. OK, so we are first going

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,940
to
consider a case where we have a function that's

78
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,340
actually just
quadratic. So, let's say I have a

79
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:26,420
function, W of (x,y) that's of the form ax^2
bxy cy^2.

80
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:33,160
OK, so this guy has a critical point at the
origin because if

81
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,590
you take the derivative with respect to x,
well, and if you plug x equals y equals zero,

82
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,310
you'll get zero, and same with respect to
y.

83
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,650
You can also see, if you try to do a linear
approximation of this, well, all these guys

84
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,690
are much
smaller than x and y when x and y are small.

85
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,720
So, the linear approximation, the tangent
plane to the graph

86
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:03,150
is really just w=0. OK, so, how do we do it?
Well, yesterday we actually did an example.

87
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,580
It was a bit more complicated than that, but
let me do it,

88
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:14,760
so remember, we were looking at something
that started with x^2 2xy 3y^2. And, there

89
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,250
were other terms.
But, let's forget them now. And, what we did

90
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,840
is we said,
well, we can rewrite this as (x y)^2 2y^2.

91
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,490
And now, this is a sum of two squares.
So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.

92
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:43,700
And so, the origin will be a minimum.
Well, it turns out we can do something similar

93
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,190
in general no
matter what the values of a, b, and c are.

94
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,160
We'll just try to first complete things to
a square.

95
00:08:50,160 --> 00:09:00,110
OK, so let's do that. So, in general,
well, let me be slightly less general, and

96
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:06,070
let me assume that
a is not zero because otherwise I can't do

97
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:15,430
what I'm going to do.
So, I'm going to write this as a times x^2

98
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:24,710
plus b over axy.
And then I have my cy^2. And now this looks

99
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,940
like the
beginning of the square of something, OK,

100
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:36,110
just like what we did over there.
So, what is it the square of? Well, you'd

101
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:45,440
start with x plus I
claim if I put b over 2a times y and I square

102
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,380
it,
then see the cross term two times x times

103
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:57,940
b over 2a y will
become b over axy. Of course, now I also get

104
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,130
some
y squares out of this. How many y squares

105
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,240
do I get?
Well, I get b^2 over 4a^2 times a.

106
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:15,580
So, I get b2 over 4a y^2. So, and I want,
in fact, c times y^2. So, the number of y^2

107
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,640
that I
should add is c minus b^2 over 4a.

108
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,660
OK, let's see that again. If I expand this
thing,

109
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:33,430
I will get ax^2 plus a times b over 2a times
2xy.

110
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,650
That's going to be my bxy. But, I also get
b^2 over 4a^2

111
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:46,360
y^2 times a. That's b^2 over 4ay^2.
And, that cancels out with this guy here.

112
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:57,590
And then, I will be left with cy^2.
OK, do you see it kind of? OK, if not, well,

113
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:07,150
try expanding this square again.
OK, maybe I'll do it just to convince you.

114
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:15,500
But, so if I expand this, I will get A times,
let me put that in a different color because

115
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,460
you shouldn't
write that down. It's just to convince you

116
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,530
again.
So, if you don't see it yet, let's expend

117
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:32,790
this thing.
We'll get a times x^2 plus a times 2xb over

118
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:41,230
2ay.
Well, the two A's cancel out. We get bxy plus

119
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:48,050
a times the
square of that's going to be b^2 over 4a^2

120
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:59,220
y^2 plus cy^2 minus
b^2 over 4ay^2. Here, the a and the a

121
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,930
simplifies, and now these two terms simplify
and give me just

122
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,390
cy^2 in the end. OK, and that's kind of
unreadable after I've canceled everything,

123
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,330
but if you follow it, you see that basically
I've

124
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:28,200
just rewritten my initial function.
OK, is that kind of OK? I mean, otherwise

125
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,710
there's just
no substitute. You'll have to do it yourself,

126
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:43,230
I'm afraid. OK, so, let me continue to play
with this. So, I'm just going to put this

127
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,740
in a slightly different form just to clear
the denominators.

128
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:56,500
OK, so, I will instead write this as one over
4a times the

129
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:08,920
big thing. So, I'm going to just put 4a^2
times x plus b over 2ay squared. OK, so far

130
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,410
I have the same
thing as here. I just introduced the 4a that

131
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,900
cancels out, plus for the other one, I'm just
clearing the

132
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:31,560
denominator. I end up with (4ac-b^2)y^2.
OK, so that's a lot of terms. But, what does

133
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,570
it look like?
Well, it looks like, so we have some constant

134
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,800
factors, and here we have a square, and here
we have a

135
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,050
square. So, basically,
we've written this as a sum of two squares,

136
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,980
well,
a sum or a difference of two squares.

137
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,779
And, maybe that's what we need to figure out
to know what kind

138
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,870
of point it is because, see, if you take a
sum of two

139
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:01,529
squares, that you will know that each
square takes nonnegative values. And you will

140
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,440
have,
the function will always take nonnegative

141
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,190
values.
So, the origin will be a minimum.

142
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,070
Well, if you have a difference of two squares
that typically

143
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,940
you'll have a saddle point because depending
on whether one

144
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,170
or the other is larger, you will have a positive
or a

145
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:23,430
negative quantity. OK, so I claim there's
various

146
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:34,220
cases to look at. So, let's see.
So, in fact, I claim there will be three

147
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,330
cases. And, that's good news for us
because after all, we want to distinguish

148
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,529
between
three possibilities. So, let's first do away

149
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:50,000
with
the most complicated one. What if 4ac minus

150
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,210
b^2 is
negative? Well, if it's negative,

151
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,180
then it means what I have between the brackets
is,

152
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:08,600
so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity,
while the second one will be something negative

153
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,380
times y2.
So, it will be a negative quantity.

154
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:23,290
OK, so one term is positive. The other is
negative.

155
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:33,040
That tells us we actually have a saddle point.
We have, in fact, written our function as

156
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,230
a
difference of two squares. OK, is that convincing?

157
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,410
So, if you want, what I could do is actually
I

158
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,190
could change my coordinates, have new coordinates
called u

159
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:53,060
equals x b over 2ay, and v, actually,
well, I could keep y, and that it would look

160
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:00,260
like the
difference of squares directly. OK, so that's

161
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:11,600
the first case.
The second case is where 4ac-b^2 = 0.

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,110
Well, what happens if that's zero?
Then it means that this term over there goes

163
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,399
away.
So, what we have is just one square.

164
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,370
OK, so what that means is actually that our
function

165
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,190
depends only on one direction of things.
In the other direction, it's going to actually

166
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,140
be
degenerate. So, for example,

167
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,700
forget all the clutter in there.
Say I give you just the function of two variables,

168
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:51,550
w equals just x^2. So, that means it doesn't
depend on y at all. And, if I try to plot

169
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,279
the
graph, it will look like, well, x is here.

170
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,270
So, it will depend on x in that way, but it
doesn't depend on y

171
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:17,990
at all. So, what the graph looks like
is something like that. OK, basically it's

172
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,900
a valley
whose bottom is completely flat. So, that

173
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,240
means,
actually, we have a degenerate critical point.

174
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
It's called degenerate because there is a
direction in which

175
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,740
nothing happens. And, in fact,
you have critical points everywhere along

176
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:41,410
the y axis.
Now, whether the square that we have is x

177
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,670
or something else,
namely, x plus b over 2a y, it doesn't matter.

178
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,090
I mean, it will still get this degenerate
behavior.

179
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,340
But there's a direction in which nothing happens
because we

180
00:17:51,340 --> 00:18:04,170
just have the square of one quantity.
I'm sure that 300 students means 300 different

181
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,440
ring tones,
but I'm not eager to hear all of them, thanks.

182
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:26,890
[LAUGHTER] OK, so, this is what's called a
degenerate critical point, and [LAUGHTER].

183
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:37,620
OK, so basically we'll leave it here.
We won't actually try to figure out further

184
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,640
what happens,
and the reason for that is that when you have

185
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,760
an actual
function, a general function,

186
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,110
not just one that's quadratic like this,
then there will actually be other terms maybe

187
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,870
involving
higher powers, maybe x^3 or y^3 or things

188
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,710
like
that. And then, they will mess up

189
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,340
what happens in this valley. And, it's a situation
where we

190
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,860
won't be able, actually, to tell automatically
just by looking at second derivatives what

191
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,950
happens.
See, for example, in a function of one variable,

192
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,390
if you have just a function of one variable,
say, f of x equals x to the five,

193
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,270
well, if you try to decide what type of point
the origin is,

194
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,720
you're going to take the second derivative.
It will be zero, and then you can conclude.

195
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,140
Those things depend on higher order derivatives.
So, we just won't like that case.

196
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,330
We just won't try to figure out what's going
on here.

197
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:45,140
Now, the last situation is if 4ac-b^2 is positive.
So, then, that means that actually we've written

198
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,670
things.
The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.

199
00:19:51,670 --> 00:20:01,980
So, that means that we've written w as one
over 4a times

200
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,910
plus something squared plus something else
squared,

201
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:14,429
OK? So, these guys have the same
sign, and that means that this term here will

202
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:21,910
always be greater
than or equal to zero. And that means that

203
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,610
we should
either have a maximum or minimum.

204
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,410
How we find out which one it is? Well, we
look at the sign of a,

205
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,610
exactly. OK?
So, there's two sub-cases. One is if a is

206
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,549
positive,
then, this quantity overall will always be

207
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:51,059
nonnegative.
And that means we have a minimum, OK?

208
00:20:51,059 --> 00:21:00,910
And, if a is negative on the other hand,
so that means that we multiply this positive

209
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,470
quantity by a
negative number, we get something that's always

210
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:18,350
negative. So, zero is actually the
maximum. OK, is that clear for everyone?

211
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:32,340
Yes? Sorry, yeah,
so I said in the example w equals x^2, it

212
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,710
doesn't depend on
y. So, the more general situation

213
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:43,730
is w equals some constant. Well, I guess it's
a times (x b

214
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,540
over 2a times y)^2. So, it does depend on
x and y,

215
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,240
but it only depends on this combination.
OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular

216
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,070
direction, in the direction where this
remains constant, so maybe if I set x equals

217
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,610
minus b over 2a y, then this remains zero
all the

218
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,000
time. So, there's a degenerate
direction in which I stay at the minimum or

219
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,290
maximum,
or whatever it is that I have. OK, so that's

220
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,040
why it's called
degenerate. There is a direction in which

221
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:29,000
nothing happens. OK, yes?
Yes, yeah, so that's a very good question.

222
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,700
So, there's going to be the second derivative
test.

223
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,610
Why do not have derivatives yet? Well, that's
because I've been

224
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,090
looking at this special example where we have
a function like

225
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,970
this. And, so I don't actually need
to take derivatives yet. But, secretly,

226
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,460
that's because a, b, and c will be the second
derivatives of the function, actually, 2a,

227
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,480
b, and 2c. So now, we are going to go to
general function. And there, instead of having

228
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,750
these coefficients a, b, and c given to us,
we'll have to compute them as second derivatives.

229
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,210
OK, so here, I'm basically setting the stage
for what will be the actual criterion we'll

230
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,929
use using second
derivatives. Yes?

231
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,580
So, yeah, so what you have a degenerate critical
point,

232
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,890
it could be a degenerate minimum, or a degenerate
maximum

233
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:26,200
depending on the sign of a. But, in general,
once you start having functions, you don't

234
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,559
really know
what will happen anymore. It could also be

235
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,570
a degenerate
saddle, and so on. So, we won't really be

236
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:40,360
able to
tell. Yes?

237
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,890
It is possible to have a degenerate saddle
point.

238
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,620
For example, if I gave you x^3 y^3,
you can convince yourself that if you take

239
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,110
x and y to be
negative, it will be negative. If x and y

240
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,090
are positive,
it's positive. And, it has a very degenerate

241
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,260
critical point at the origin. So, that's a
degenerate saddle

242
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,280
point. We don't see it here because
that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic

243
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,429
terms like that.
You need to have higher-order terms to see

244
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:22,169
it happen.
OK. OK, so let's continue.

245
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,950
Before we continue, but see, I wanted to point
out

246
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:33,470
one small thing. So, here, we have the magic
quantity, 4ac minus b^2. You've probably seen

247
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,690
that
before in your life. Yet, it looks like the

248
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,390
quadratic formula, except that one involves
b^2-4ac. But that's really the same

249
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:54,770
thing. OK, so 
let's see,
where does the quadratic formula come in here?

250
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:02,770
Well, let me write things differently.
OK, so we've manipulated things, and got into

251
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,840
a
conclusion. But, let me just do a different

252
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:19,760
manipulation, and write this now instead as
y^2 times a times x over y squared plus b(x

253
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,950
over y) plus c.
OK, see, that's the same thing that I had

254
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:32,470
before.
Well, so now this quantity here is always

255
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:39,340
nonnegative.
What about this one? Well, of course,

256
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,230
this one depends on x over y. It means it
depends on which

257
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,840
direction you're going to move away from the
origin,

258
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,559
which ratio between x and y you will consider.
But, I claim there's two situations.

259
00:25:51,559 --> 00:26:00,130
One is, so, let's try to reformulate things.
So, if a discriminate here is positive, then

260
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:08,790
it means that
these have roots and these have solutions.

261
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,860
And, that means that this quantity can be
both positive

262
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:30,190
and negative. This quantity takes positive
and negative values. One way to convince yourself

263
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:37,590
is
just to, you know, plot at^2 bt c.

264
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,260
You know that there's two roots. So, it might
look like this,

265
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,350
or might look like that depending on the sign
of a.

266
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,970
But, in either case, it will take values of
both

267
00:26:51,970 --> 00:27:03,400
signs. So, that means that your
function will take values of both signs.

268
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:10,690
The value takes both positive and negative
values.

269
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:26,070
And, so that means we have a saddle point,
while the other situation, when b^2-4ac is

270
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:35,600
negative -- --
means that this equation is quadratic never

271
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,450
takes the value,
zero. So, it's always positive or

272
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,690
it's always negative, depending on the sign
of a.

273
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:53,410
So, the other case is if b^2-4ac is negative,
then the quadratic doesn't have a solution.

274
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,900
And it could look like this or like that depending
on whether a

275
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:06,970
is positive or a is negative. So, in particular,
that means that ax over y2 plus bx over y

276
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:20,240
plus c is always
positive or always negative depending on the

277
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,110
sign of a.
And then, that tells us that our function,

278
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:31,990
w, will be always positive or always negative.
And then we'll get a minimum or maximum.

279
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:43,630
OK, we'll have a min or a max depending on
which situation we

280
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,630
are in. OK, so that's another way to
derive the same answer. And now, you see here

281
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,630
why the
discriminate plays a role. That's because

282
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,429
it exactly tells
you whether this quadratic quantity has always

283
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,280
the same
sign, or whether it can actually

284
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,000
cross the value, zero, when you have the root
of

285
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:19,950
a quadratic. OK, so hopefully at this stage
you are happy with one of the two explanations,

286
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,820
at least. And now, you are willing to
believe, I hope, that we have basically a

287
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,130
way of
deciding what type of critical point we have

288
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:42,030
in the special
case of a quadratic function.

289
00:29:42,030 --> 00:30:06,620
OK, so, now what do we do with the general
function?

290
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:23,750
Well, so in general, we want to look at second
derivatives. OK, so now we are getting to

291
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,039
the real stuff. So, how many second derivatives
do we have? That's maybe the first thing we

292
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,470
should figure out. Well, we can take the
derivative first with respect to x, and then

293
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,760
again with respect
to x. OK, that gives us something we

294
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:50,669
denote by partial square f over partial x
squared or fxx.

295
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:59,980
Then, there's another one which is fxy, which
means you take the

296
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,580
derivative with respect to x, and then with
respect to y.

297
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,970
Another thing you can do, is do first derivative
respect

298
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:17,630
to y, and then with respect to x.
That would be fyx. Well, good news.

299
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:24,809
These are actually always equal to each other.
OK, so it's the fact that we will admit, it's

300
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:29,049
actually not
very hard to check. So these are always the

301
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,169
same.
We don't need to worry about which one we

302
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:36,220
do.
That's one computation that we won't need

303
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,780
to do.
We can save a bit of effort. And then, we

304
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,970
have the last one,
namely, the second partial with respect to

305
00:31:44,970 --> 00:32:00,610
y and y fyy.
OK, so we have three of them. So, what does

306
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:06,760
the second
derivative test say?

307
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:23,539
It says, say that you have a critical point
(x0,

308
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:34,360
y0) of a function of two variables, f,
and then let's compute the partial derivatives.

309
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,340
So, let's call capital A the second derivative
with respect

310
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:49,539
to x. Let's call capital B the second
derivative with respect to x and y.

311
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:58,780
And C equals fyy at this point, OK?
So, these are just numbers because we first

312
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,850
compute the
second derivative, and then we plug in the

313
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,299
values
of x and y at the critical point.

314
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:09,630
So, these will just be numbers. And now, what
we do is we look

315
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:21,580
at the quantity AC-B^2. I am not forgetting
the four.

316
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:30,530
You will see why there isn't one.
So, if AC-B^2 is positive, then there's two

317
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:43,000
sub-cases.
If A is positive, then it's local minimum.

318
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:59,530
The 
second case, so, still, if AC-B^2 is
positive, but A is negative, then it's going

319
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:12,359
to be a local
maximum. And, if AC-B^2 is negative,

320
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:21,299
then it's a saddle point, and finally,
if AC-B^2 is zero, then we actually cannot

321
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:32,969
compute. We don't know whether it's
going to be a minimum, a maximum, or a saddle.

322
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,049
We know it's degenerate in some way, but we
don't know what type

323
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:40,190
of point it is. OK, so that's actually what
you

324
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,529
need to remember. If you are formula oriented,
that's all you need to remember about today.

325
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:49,009
But, let's try to understand why, how this
comes out of what

326
00:34:49,009 --> 00:35:04,289
we had there. OK, so, I think maybe I
actually want to keep, so maybe I want to

327
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,259
keep this
middle board because it actually has,

328
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:09,229
you know, the recipe that we found before
the quadratic

329
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:33,119
function. So, let me move directly over
there and try to relate our old recipe with

330
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:54,920
the new.
OK, you are easily amused. OK, so first,

331
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,849
let's check that these two things say the
same thing in the

332
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:09,019
special case that we are looking at.
OK, so let's verify in the special case where

333
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:25,170
the function
was ax^2 bxy cy^2. So -- Well, what is the

334
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,519
second
derivative with respect to x and x?

335
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,809
If I take the second derivative with respect
to x and x,

336
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,920
so first I want to take maybe the derivative
with respect to

337
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:45,289
x. But first, let's take the first
partial, Wx. That will be 2ax by, right?

338
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:50,859
So, Wxx will be, well, let's take a partial
with

339
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:59,430
respect to x again. That's 2a.
Wxy, I take the partial respect to y, and

340
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,989
we'll get b.
OK, now we need, also, the partial with respect

341
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:14,859
to y. So, Wy is bx 2cy.
In case you don't believe what I told you

342
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:20,660
about the mixed
partials, Wyx, well, you can check.

343
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:31,160
And it's, again, b. So, they are,
indeed, the same thing. And, Wyy will be 2c.

344
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:39,609
So, if we now look at these quantities, that
tells us,

345
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:46,079
well, big A is two little a, big B is little
b,

346
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:54,609
big C is two little c. So, AC-B^2 is what
we used to

347
00:37:54,609 --> 00:38:07,150
call four little ac minus b2. OK, ooh.
[LAUGHTER] So, now you can compare the

348
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:14,700
cases. They are not listed in the same
order just to make it harder. So, we said

349
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,519
first,
so the saddle case is when AC-B^2 in big letters

350
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,589
is
negative, that's the same as 4ac-b2 in lower

351
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:29,599
case is
negative. The case where capital AC-B2 is

352
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,229
positive, local min and local max corresponds
to this one.

353
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:39,910
And, the case where we can't conclude was
what used to be the

354
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:48,119
degenerate one. OK, so at least we don't seem
to have messed up when copying the formula.

355
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,900
Now, why does that work more generally than
that?

356
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:14,279
Well, the answer that is, again, Taylor approximation.
Aww. OK, so let me just do here

357
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:25,239
quadratic approximation. So, quadratic approximation
tells me the following thing. It tells me,

358
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,960
if I have a function, f of xy, and I want
to

359
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,130
understand the change in f when I change x
and y a little bit.

360
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,549
Well, there's the first-order terms.
There is the linear terms that by now you

361
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:48,150
should know and be
comfortable with. That's fx times the change

362
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:55,299
in x.
And then, there's fy times the change in y.

363
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:59,579
OK, that's the starting point. But now, of
course,

364
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:07,630
if x and y, sorry, if we are at the critical
point, then that's going to be zero at the

365
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:15,959
critical point.
So, that term actually goes away, and that's

366
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:20,589
also zero at
the critical point. So, that term also goes

367
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:24,700
away.
OK, so linear approximation is really no good.

368
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,319
We need more terms. So, what are the next
terms?

369
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:39,479
Well, the next terms are quadratic terms,
and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor

370
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:45,200
formula for a function of a single variable,
there was the derivative times x minus x0

371
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,019
plus one half of a
second derivative times x-x0^2. And see, this

372
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:53,680
side here is
really Taylor approximation in one variable

373
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,769
looking only at x.
But of course, we also have terms involving

374
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,420
y,
and terms involving simultaneously x and y.

375
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,920
And, these terms are fxy times change in x
times change in y

376
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:17,099
plus one half of fyy(y-y0)^2. There's no one
half in the

377
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,859
middle because, in fact, you would have two
terms, one for xy, one for yx, but they are

378
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,109
the
same. And then, if you want to

379
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:28,329
continue, there is actually cubic terms involving
the third

380
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:30,599
derivatives, and so on, but we are not actually
looking

381
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:40,979
at them. And so, now,
when we do this approximation, well, the type

382
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:44,059
of critical
point remains the same when we replace the

383
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:48,839
function by this
approximation. And so, we can apply the

384
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,569
argument that we used to deduce things in
the quadratic case.

385
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:55,459
In fact, it still works in the general case
using this

386
00:41:55,459 --> 00:42:26,099
approximation formula.
So -- 
The general case reduces to 
the quadratic case.

387
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,450
And now, you see actually why, well, here
you see,

388
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:36,119
again, how this coefficient which we used
to call little a

389
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:44,009
is also one half of capital A. And same here:
this coefficient is what we call capital B

390
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:47,219
or little b,
and this coefficient here is what we called

391
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:57,329
little c or one
half of capital C. And then, when you replace

392
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:04,910
these into the various cases that we had here,
you end up with the second derivative test.

393
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:11,039
So, what about the degenerate case?
Why can't we just say, well, it's going to

394
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,680
be a
degenerate critical point? So, the reason

395
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,509
is that this
approximation formula is reasonable only if

396
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:23,609
the higher
order terms are negligible. OK, so in fact,

397
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,150
secretly, there's more terms. This is only
an approximation.

398
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:33,479
There would be terms involving third derivatives,
and maybe even beyond that. And, so it is

399
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:36,319
not to generate
case, they don't actually matter

400
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,920
because the shape of the function,
the shape of the graph, is actually determined

401
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,369
by the
quadratic terms. But, in the degenerate case,

402
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:48,680
see, if I start with this and I add something
even very,

403
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,489
very small along the y axis, then that can
be enough to bend

404
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:58,309
this very slightly up or slightly down,
and turn my degenerate point in to either

405
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:02,549
a minimum or a saddle
point. And, I won't be able to tell

406
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:15,779
until I go further in the list of derivatives.
So, in the degenerate case, what actually

407
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:32,249
happens depends
on the higher order derivatives.

408
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:44,339
So, we will need to analyze things more carefully.
Well, we're not going to bother with that

409
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:48,589
in this class.
So, we'll just say, well, we cannot compute,

410
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:55,400
OK? I mean, you have to realize
that in real life, you have to be extremely

411
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,430
unlucky for this quantity to end up being
exactly 0.

412
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,809
[LAUGHTER] Well, if that happens,
then what you should do is maybe try by inspection.

413
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,140
See if there's a good reason why the function
should always

414
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,569
be positive or always be negative, or something.
Or, you know, plot it on a computer and see

415
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:31,209
what happens. But, otherwise we can't compute.
OK, so let's do an example. So, probably I

416
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:35,640
should leave
this on so that we still have the test with

417
00:45:35,640 --> 00:46:01,420
us.
And, instead, OK, so I'll do my example here.

418
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:28,670
OK, so just an example. Let's look at f of
(x,

419
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:38,539
y) = x y 1/xy, where x and y are positive.
So, I'm looking only at the first quadrant.

420
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:41,950
OK, I mean, I'm doing this because I don't
want the

421
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,549
denominator to become zero. So, I'm just looking
at the

422
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:52,759
situation. So, let's look first for,
so, the question will be, what are the minimum

423
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:58,959
and
maximum of this function? So, the first thing

424
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:05,769
we should
do to answer this question is look for critical

425
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:14,180
points,
OK? So, for that,

426
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:34,690
we have to compute the first derivatives.
OK, so fx is one minus one over x^2y, OK?

427
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,269
Take the derivative of one over x, that's
negative one over x^2.

428
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:49,299
And, we'll want to set that equal to zero.
And fy is one minus one over xy^2.

429
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:57,709
And, we want to set that equal to zero.
So, what are the equations we have to solve?

430
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:06,920
Well, I guess x^2y equals one, I mean, if
I move this guy over

431
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,900
here I get one over x^2y equals one.
That's x^2y equals one, and xy^2 equals one.

432
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:21,839
What do you get by comparing these two?
Well, x and y should both be, OK, so yeah,

433
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:27,099
I agree with you that one and one is a solution.
Why is it the only one? So, first, if I divide

434
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:29,259
this one
by that one, I get x over y equals one.

435
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:34,690
So, it tells me x equals y. And then, if x
equals y,

436
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:40,390
then if I put that into here, it will give
me y^3 equals one,

437
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:49,249
which tells me y equals one, and therefore,
x equals one as well. OK, so, there's only

438
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:52,630
one
solution. There's only one critical

439
00:48:52,630 --> 00:49:06,609
point, which is going to be (1,1).
OK, so, now here's where you do a bit of work.

440
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:22,789
What do you think of that critical point?
OK, I see some valid votes. I see some, OK,

441
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:29,849
I see a lot of people answering four.
[LAUGHTER] that seems to suggest that

442
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,559
maybe you haven't completed the second derivative
yet.

443
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:40,549
Yes, I see someone giving the correct answer.
I see some people not giving quite the correct

444
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:43,559
answer.
I see more and more correct answers.

445
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,880
OK, so let's see. To figure out what type
of

446
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,359
point is, we should compute the second partial
derivatives.

447
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:59,349
So, fxx is, what do we get what we take the
derivative of this

448
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:21,690
with respect to x? Two over x^3y, OK?
So, at our point, a will be 2. Fxy will be

449
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:33,150
one over x^2y^2.
So, B will be one. And, Fyy is going to be

450
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:42,589
two
over xy^3. So, C will be two.

451
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:50,269
And so that tells us, well, AC-B^2 is four
minus one.

452
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:58,549
Sorry, I should probably use a different blackboard
for that.

453
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:09,989
AC-B2 is two times two minus 1^2 is three.
It's positive. That tells us we are either

454
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:14,699
a
local minimum or local maximum. And, A is

455
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:20,369
positive.
So, it's a local minimum. And, in fact,

456
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:28,829
you can check it's the global minimum.
What about the maximum? Well, if a maximum

457
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,449
is not
actually at a critical point, it's on the

458
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:34,509
boundary,
or at infinity. See, so we have actually to

459
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:39,299
check what happens when x and y go to zero
or to infinity.

460
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:44,229
Well, if that happens, if x or y goes to infinity,
then the function goes to infinity.

461
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:47,900
Also, if x or y goes to zero, then one over
xy goes to

462
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:56,539
infinity. So, the maximum,
well, the function goes to infinity when x

463
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:03,900
goes to infinity
or y goes to infinity, or x and y go to zero.

464
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,109
So, it's not at a critical point.
OK, so, in general, we have to check both

465
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:12,059
the
critical points and the boundaries to decide

466
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,019
what
happens. OK, the end.

467
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:16,039
Have a nice weekend.
