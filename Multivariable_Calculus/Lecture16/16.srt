6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,519
So, basically the last few weeks, we've been
doing

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:42,120
derivatives. Now, we're going to integrals.
So -- OK, so more precisely, we are going

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:01:00,249
to be talking
about double integrals. OK, so just to motivate

9
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,269
the
notion, let me just remind you that

10
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:14,710
when you have a function of one variable -- -- say,
f of x, and you take its integrals

11
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:29,430
from, say, a to b of f of x dx,
well, that corresponds to the area below the

12
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:40,659
graph of f over
the interval from a to b. OK, so the picture

13
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:47,689
is something
like you have a; you have b.

14
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:54,490
You have the graph of f, and then what the
integral

15
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:04,180
measures is the area of this region.
And, when we say the area of this region,

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,500
of course,
if f is positive, that's what happens.

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,619
If f is negative, then we count negatively
the

18
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:19,400
area below the x axis. OK, so, now,
when you have a function of two variables,

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,120
then you can try to
do the same thing. Namely, you can plot its

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,959
graph.
Its graph will be a surface in space.

21
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,459
And then, we can try to look for the volume
below the graph.

22
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,620
And that's what we will call the double integral
of the

23
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:42,030
function over a certain region. OK, so let's
say that we have a

24
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:55,530
function of two variables, x and y.
Then, we'll look at the volume that's below

25
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:07,640
the graph z equals
f of xy. OK, so, let's draw a picture

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,620
for what this means. I have a function of
x and y.

27
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,580
I can draw its graph. The graph will be the
surface

28
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:24,299
with equation z equals f of x and y.
And, well, I have to decide where I will integrate

29
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,409
the
function. So, for that,

30
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:33,000
I will choose some region in the xy plane.
And, I will integrate the function on that

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,680
region.
So, it's over a region, R, in the xy plane.

32
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,370
So, I have this region R and I look at the
piece of the graph

33
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,180
that is above this region. And, we'll try
to compute the

34
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,500
volume of this solid here. OK, that's what
the double

35
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:09,329
integral will measure. So, we'll call that
the double

36
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,459
integral of our region, R, of f of xy dA and
I will

37
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:21,640
have to explain what the notation means.
So, dA here stands for a piece of area.

38
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,020
A stands for area. And, well, it's a double
integral. So, that's why we have two

39
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,870
integral signs. And, we'll have to indicate
somehow the region over which we are integrating.

40
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,200
OK, we'll come up with more concrete notations
when we see

41
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,410
how to actually compute these things.
That's the basic definition. OK, so actually,

42
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,780
how do we define it, that's not really much
of a

43
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,130
definition yet. How do we actually define
this

44
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:55,720
rigorously? Well, remember,
the integral in one variable, you probably

45
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,850
saw a definition
where you take your integral from a to b,

46
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,530
and you cut it into little pieces.
And then, for each little piece, you take

47
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,630
the value of a
function, and you multiply by the width of

48
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,870
a piece.
That gives you a rectangular slice, and then

49
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,870
you sum all of
these rectangular slices together.

50
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,780
So, here we'll do the same thing.
So, well, let me put a picture up and explain

51
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,750
what it does.
So, we're going to cut our origin into little

52
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,070
pieces,
say, little rectangles or actually anything

53
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,320
we want.
And then, for each piece, with the small area,

54
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,630
delta A,
we'll take the area delta a times the value

55
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,490
of a function in
there that will give us the volume of a small

56
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,060
box that sits
under the graph. And then, we'll add all these

57
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,720
boxes together. That gives us an estimate
of a

58
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,080
volume. And then, to get actually the
integral, the integral will be defined as

59
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,610
a limit as we subdivide into smaller and smaller
boxes,

60
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,070
and we sum more and more pieces,
OK? So, actually,

61
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:20,250
what we do, oh, I still have a board here.
So, the actual definition involves cutting

62
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:31,390
R into small
pieces 
of area that's called delta A or maybe delta

63
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,960
Ai,
the area of the i'th piece. And then, OK,

64
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:45,890
so maybe in the xy plane, we have our region,
and we'll cut it may be using some grade.

65
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:57,200
OK, and then we'll have each small piece.
Each small piece will have area delta Ai and

66
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:05,360
it will be at some
point, let's call it xi, yi ...

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:17,510
yi, xi. And then, we'll consider the
sum over all the pieces of f at that point,

68
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,820
xi,
yi times the area of a small piece.

69
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,540
So, what that corresponds to in the three-dimensional
picture is

70
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,780
just I sum the volumes of all of these little
columns that sit

71
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:50,190
under the graph. OK, and then,
so what I do is actually I take the limit

72
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,020
as the size of the
pieces tends to zero. So, I have more and

73
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,520
more
smaller and smaller pieces. And, that gives

74
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:09,220
me the double
integral. OK, so that's not a very good

75
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,980
sentence, but whatever. So, OK, so that's
the

76
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,300
definition. Of course, we will have to see
how to compute it. We don't actually compute

77
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,440
it.
When you compute an integral in single variable

78
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,910
calculus,
you don't do that. You don't cut into little

79
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,020
pieces and sum the pieces together.
You've learned how to integrate functions

80
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,730
using various
formulas, and similarly here,

81
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,520
we'll learn how to actually compute these
things without

82
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,010
doing that cutting into small pieces.
OK, any questions first about the concept,

83
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:45,130
or what the
definition is? Yes?

84
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,100
Well, so we'll have to learn which tricks
work,

85
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,040
and how exactly. But, so what we'll do actually
is we'll reduce the calculation of a double

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,750
integral to two
calculations of single integrals.

87
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,850
And so, for V, certainly, all the tricks
you've learned in single variable calculus

88
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,610
will come in
handy. OK, so,

89
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,470
yeah that's a strong suggestion that if you've
forgotten

90
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,990
everything about single variable calculus,
now would be a good time to actually brush

91
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,880
up on integrals.
The usual integrals, and the usual substitution

92
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,200
tricks and easy trig in particular, these
would be very

93
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,400
useful. OK, so, yeah,
how do we compute these things? That's what

94
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,770
we would have to
come up with. And, well,

95
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,330
going back to what we did with derivatives,
to understand variations of functions and

96
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,150
derivatives,
what we did was really we took slices parallel

97
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,150
to an axis or
another one. So, in fact,

98
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,530
here, the key is also the same. So, what we
are going to do is

99
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,940
instead of cutting into a lot of small boxes
like that and

100
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,690
summing completely at random, we will actually
somehow scan

101
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,470
through our region by parallel planes,
OK? So, let me put up,

102
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,870
actually, a slightly different picture up
here.

103
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,450
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take
planes,

104
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,200
say in this picture, parallel to the yz plane.
I'll take a moving plane that scans from the

105
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,030
back to the front
or from the front to the back. So, that means

106
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,440
I set the value
of x, and I look at the slice, x equals x0,

107
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,330
and then I will do that for all values of
x0.

108
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,510
So, now in each slice, well, I get what looks
a lot

109
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,030
like a single variable integral. OK, and that
integral will tell

110
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,560
me, what is the area in this? Well, I guess
it's supposed to

111
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,190
be green, but it all comes as black, so, let's
say the black

112
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:54,250
shaded slice. And then, when I add all of
these areas together, as the value of x changes,

113
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,750
I will get the volume. OK, let me try to explain
that

114
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:14,010
again. So, to compute this integral,
what we do is actually we take slices.

115
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:27,220
So, let's consider, let's call s of x the
area of a

116
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:39,860
slice, well, by a plane parallel to the yz
plane.

117
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,270
OK, so on the picture, s of x is just the
area of this

118
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:51,480
thing in the vertical wall. Now, if you sum
all of these,

119
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,040
well, why does that work? So, if you take
the origin

120
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,570
between two parallel slices that are very
close to each other,

121
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:05,560
what's the volume in these two things?
Well, it's essentially s of x times the thickness

122
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,160
of this very
thin slice, and the thickness would be

123
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,570
delta x0 dx if you take a limit with more
and more slices.

124
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:26,550
OK, so the volume will be the integral of
s of x dx from,

125
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:34,490
well, what should be the range for x?
Well, we would have to start at the very lowest

126
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,860
value of x that
ever happens in our origin, and we'd have

127
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,600
to go all the way
to the very largest value of x, from the very

128
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,900
far back to the
very far front. So, in this picture,

129
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,480
we probably start over here at the back, and
we'd end over here

130
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:12,730
at the front. So, let me just say from the
minimum, x, to the maximum x. 
And now, how do we find S of x?

131
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,600
Well, S of x will be actually again an integral.
But now, it's an integral of the variable,

132
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,290
y, because when we look at this slice, what
changes from left to

133
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:39,080
right is y. So, well let me actually write
that down. For a given,

134
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,440
x, the area S of x you can compute as an integral
of f of

135
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:57,480
x, y dy. OK, well, now x is a constant,
and y will be the variable of integration.

136
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,370
What's the range for y? Well, it's from the
leftmost

137
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,370
point here to the rightmost point here on
the given slice.

138
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,880
So, there is a big catch here. That's a very
important thing

139
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,600
to remember. What is the range of
integration? The range of integration for

140
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
y
depends actually on x. See, if I take the

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,670
slice that's
pictured on that diagram, then the range for

142
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,110
y goes all
the way from the very left to the very right.

143
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,070
But, if I take a slice that, say, near the
very front,

144
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,560
then in fact, only a very small segment of
it

145
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,370
will be in my region. So, the range of values
for y

146
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,320
will be much less. Let me actually draw a
2D

147
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:48,320
picture for that. So, remember,
we fix x, so, sorry, so we fix a value of

148
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,089
x.
OK, and for a given value of x, what we will

149
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,720
do is we'll slice
our graph by this plane parallel to the yz

150
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,790
plane.
So, now we mention the graph is sitting above

151
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,670
that.
OK, that's the region R. We have the region,

152
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,779
R, and I have the graph of a function above
this region,

153
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:18,140
R. And, I'm trying to find the
area between this segment and the graph above

154
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,720
it in this
vertical plane. Well, to do that,

155
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:33,310
I have to integrate from y going from here
to here.

156
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,500
I want the area of a piece that sits above
this red segment.

157
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,540
And, so in particular, the endpoints,
the extreme values for y depend on x because,

158
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:52,510
see, if I slice here instead,
well, my bounds for y will be smaller.

159
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:08,000
OK, so now, if I put the two things together,
what I will get -- -- 
is actually a formula where I have

160
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:24,390
to integrate -- -- over x -- -- an integral
over y.

161
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:36,899
OK, and so this is called an iterated integral
because we

162
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:57,680
iterate twice the process of taking an integral.
OK, so again, what's important to realize

163
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,290
here, I mean, I'm going to say that
several times over the next few days but that's

164
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,760
because it's the
single most important thing to remember about

165
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,569
double integrals,
the bounds here are just going to be numbers,

166
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,829
OK, because the question I'm asking myself
here is,

167
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,209
what is the first value of x by which I might
want to slice,

168
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,829
and what is the last value of x? Which range
of x do I want to

169
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,660
look at to take my red slices? And, the answer
is I would go

170
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:34,840
all the way from here, that's my first slice,
to somewhere here. That's my last slice.

171
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,920
For any value in between these, I will have
some red segment,

172
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,429
and I will want to integrate over that that.
On the other hand here, the bounds will depend

173
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,910
on the
outer variable, x,

174
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,870
because at a fixed value of x, what the values
of y will be

175
00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:00,240
depends on x in general. OK, so I think we
should do

176
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,760
lots of examples to convince ourselves and
see how it works.

177
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah, it's called an iterated integral because
first we

178
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:20,950
integrated over y, and then we integrate again
over x, OK? So, we can do that,

179
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,690
well, I mean, y depends on x or x depends,
no, actually x and y vary independently of

180
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,390
each other
inside here. What is more complicated is how

181
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,130
the bounds on y depend on x. But actually,
you could also do the other way around: first

182
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,880
integrate over x,
and then over y, and then the bounds for x

183
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,730
will
depend on y. We'll see that on an example.

184
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:55,620
Yes? So, for y, I'm using the range
of values for y that corresponds to the given

185
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,150
value of x,
OK? Remember, this is just like a

186
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,630
plot in the xy plane. Above that, we have
the graph.

187
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,020
Maybe I should draw a picture here instead.
For a given value of x, so that's a given

188
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,960
slice,
I have a range of values for y, that is,

189
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,160
from this picture at the leftmost point on
that slice to

190
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,809
the rightmost point on that slice.
So, where start and where I stop depends on

191
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:28,929
the value of x.
Does that make sense? OK.

192
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:40,610
OK, no more questions? OK, so let's do our
first

193
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:56,270
example. So, let's say that we want to
integrate the function 1-x^2-y^2 over the

194
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:04,890
region defined by x
between 0 and 1, and y between 0 and 1.

195
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:14,950
So, what does that mean geometrically?
Well, z = 1-x^2-y^2, and it's a variation

196
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,250
on,
actually I think we plotted that one, right?

197
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,360
That was our first example of a function of
two variables

198
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,929
possibly. And, so, we saw that the graph
is this paraboloid pointing downwards.

199
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,799
OK, it's what you get by taking a parabola
and rotating it.

200
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,830
And now, what we are asking is, what is the
volume between the

201
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,620
paraboloid and the xy plane over the square
of side one in the xy

202
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,460
plane over the square of side one in the xy
plane,

203
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:49,390
x and y between zero and one. OK, so, what
we'll do is we'll,

204
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:59,010
so, see, here I try to represent the square.
And, we'll just sum the areas of the slices

205
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,049
as,
say, x varies from zero to one. And here,

206
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,270
of course,
setting up the bounds will be easy because

207
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,860
no matter what x I
take, y still goes from zero to one.

208
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,090
See, it's easiest to do double integrals what
the region is

209
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,220
just a rectangle on the xy plane because then
you don't have to

210
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:28,700
worry too much about what are the ranges.
OK, so let's do it. Well, that would be the

211
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,710
integral from zero to one of the integral
from zero to one of

212
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:44,670
1-x^2-y^2 dy dx. So, I'm dropping the
parentheses. But, if you still want to see

213
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,860
them, I'm going to put that in very thin so
that you see what

214
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,480
it means. But, actually,
the convention is we won't put this parentheses

215
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,360
in there
anymore. OK, so what this means is first

216
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,870
I will integrate 1-x^2-y^2 over y, ranging
from zero to one with

217
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,250
x held fixed. So, what that represents is
the

218
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:13,280
area in this slice. So, see here,
I've drawn, well, what happens is actually

219
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,570
the
function takes positive and negative values.

220
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,490
So, in fact, I will be counting positively
this part of the area. And, I will be counting

221
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:32,110
negatively this part of the area, I mean,
as usual when I do an integral. OK, so what

222
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,880
I will do to
evaluate this, I will first do what's called

223
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:52,510
the inner integral. So, to do the inner integral,
well, it's pretty easy. How do I integrate

224
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,429
this?
Well, it becomes, so, what's the integral

225
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,200
of one?
It's y. Just anything to remember is we

226
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,160
are integrating this with respect to y,
not to x. The integral of x^2 is x^2

227
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:17,600
times y. And, the integral of y^2 is y^3
over 3. OK, and that we plug in the

228
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,980
bounds, which are zero and one in this case.
And so, when you plug y equals one, you will

229
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:33,480
get one minus x^2
minus one third minus, well, for y equals

230
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,920
zero you get
0,0, 0, so nothing changes. OK, so you are

231
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,970
left with two
thirds minus x^2. OK, and that's a function

232
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,429
of x
only. Here, you shouldn't see any y's

233
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:52,390
anymore because y was your integration variable.
But, you still have x. You still have x because

234
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,929
the
area of this shaded slice depends, of course,

235
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:06,870
on the value of x. And, so now,
the second thing to do is to do the outer

236
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:15,690
integral.
So, now we integrate from zero to one what

237
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,490
we got,
which is two thirds minus x^2 dx.

238
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,350
OK, and we know how to compute that because
that integrates to

239
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,830
two thirds x minus one third x^3 between zero
and one.

240
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:39,690
And, I'll let you do the computation.
You will find it's one third. OK, so that's

241
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,720
the final answer.
So, that's the general pattern. When we have

242
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,990
a double integral
to compute, first we want to set it up carefully.

243
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,390
We want to find, what will be the bounds in
x

244
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,929
and y? And here, that was actually
pretty easy because our equation was very

245
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,030
simple.
Then, we want to compute the inner integral,

246
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:06,799
and then we compute the outer integral.
And, that's it. OK, any questions at this

247
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:16,419
point?
No? OK, so, by the way,

248
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:24,240
we started with dA in the notation, right?
Here we had dA. And, that somehow became a

249
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,950
dy
dx. OK,

250
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:39,130
so, dA became dy dx because when we
do the iterated integral this way,

251
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,320
what we're actually doing is that we are slicing
our origin

252
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,919
into small rectangles. OK, that was the area
of this

253
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,380
small rectangle here? Well, it's the product
of its

254
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,169
width times its height. So, that's delta x
times delta

255
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:05,059
y. OK, so, delta a equals delta x
delta y becomes... So actually,

256
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:26,980
it's not just becomes, it's really equal.
So, the small rectangles for. Now, it became

257
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,309
dy dx and not dx
dy. Well, that's a question of,

258
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,690
in which order we do the iterated integral?
It's up to us to decide whether we want to

259
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,710
integrate x first,
then y, or y first, then x.

260
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,669
But, as we'll see very soon, that is an important
decision

261
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,000
when it comes to setting up the bounds of
integration.

262
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,090
Here, it doesn't matter, but in general we
have to be

263
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:57,710
very careful about in which order we 
will do things.
Yes? Well, in principle it always

264
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:03,070
works both ways. Sometimes it will be that
because the region has a strange shape, you

265
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,000
can actually set it
up more easily one way or the other.

266
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,850
Sometimes it will also be that the function
here,

267
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,000
you actually know how to integrate in one
way,

268
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,110
but not the other. So, the theory is that
it

269
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:24,880
should work both ways. In practice,
one of the two calculations may be much harder.

270
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:37,850
OK. Let's do another example.
Let's say that what I wanted to know was not

271
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,400
actually what I
computed, namely, the volume below the

272
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,740
paraboloid, but also the negative of some
part that's now in the corner towards me.

273
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,679
But let's say really what I wanted was just
the volume

274
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,940
between the paraboloid and the xy plane,
so looking only at the part of it that sits

275
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,870
above the xy plane.
So, that means, instead of integrating over

276
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,000
the
entire square of size one, I should just integrate

277
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,010
over
the quarter disk. I should stop integrating

278
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,510
where
my paraboloid hits the xy plane. So, let me

279
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:20,240
draw another picture.
So, let's say I wanted to integrate, actually

280
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:35,549
-- So,
let's call this example two. So, we are going

281
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,559
to do the same
function but over a different region.

282
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,840
And, the region will just be, now, this quarter
disk here.

283
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:55,660
OK, so maybe I should draw a picture on the
xy plane.

284
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:17,590
That's your region, R. OK, so in principle,
it will be the same integral. But what changes

285
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,470
is the bounds.
Why do the bounds change? Well, the bounds

286
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:27,400
change because
now if I set, if I fixed some value of x,

287
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,910
then I want to integrate this part of the
slice that's above

288
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,400
the xy plane and I don't want to take this
part that's actually

289
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,799
outside of my disk. So, I should stop integrating
over y when y reaches this value here.

290
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:50,880
OK, on that picture here, on this picture,
it tells me for a fixed value of x, the range

291
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,270
of values for y
should go only from here to here.

292
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:12,250
So, that's from here to less than one.
OK, so for a given, x, the range of y is,

293
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,320
well, so what's the lowest value of y that
we want to look

294
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,679
at? It's still zero.
From y equals zero to,what's the value of

295
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,780
y here?
Well, I have to solve in the equation of a

296
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,330
circle,
OK? So, if I'm here,

297
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:38,330
this is x^2 y^2 equals one. That means y is
square root of

298
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,070
one minus x^2. OK, so I will integrate from
y

299
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,970
equals zero to y equals square root of one
minus x^2.

300
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,830
And, now you see how the bound from y will
depend on the value

301
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:59,450
of x. OK, so while I erase,
I will let you think about, what is the bound

302
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:21,620
for x now?
It's a trick question.

303
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:50,940
OK, so I claim that what we will do -- We
write this as an

304
00:31:50,940 --> 00:32:00,600
iterated integral first dy then dx.
And, we said for a fixed value of x, the range

305
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:09,610
for y is from
zero to square root of one minus x^2.

306
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,280
What about the range for x? Well, the range
for x should

307
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,380
just be numbers. OK, remember,
the question I have to ask now is if I look

308
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,679
at all of these
yellow slices, which one is the first one

309
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,480
that
I will consider? Which one is the last one

310
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,330
that
I want to consider? So, the smallest value

311
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,330
of x
that I want to consider is zero again.

312
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,610
And then, I will have actually a pretty big
slice.

313
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,570
And I will get smaller, and smaller,
and smaller slices. And, it stops.

314
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,490
I have to stop when x equals one.
Afterwards, there's nothing else to integrate.

315
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:53,850
So, x goes from zero to one. OK, and now,
see how in the inner integral, the bounds

316
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,799
depend on in the
inner integral, the bounds depend on x.

317
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,740
In the outer one, you just get numbers because
the questions that you have to ask to set

318
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,580
up this one and set
up that one are different. Here, the question

319
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,429
is,
if I fix a given, x, if I look at a given

320
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:10,780
slice,
what's the range for y? Here, the question

321
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,960
is,
what's the first slice? What is the last slice?

322
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,750
Does that make sense? Everyone happy with
that?

323
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:28,730
OK, very good. So, now, how do we compute
that?

324
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,520
Well, we do the inner integral. So, that's
an integral from

325
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:41,299
zero to square root of one minus x^2 of one
minus x^2 minus y^2

326
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:52,919
dy. And, well, that integrates to
y-x^2y-y^3 over three from zero to square

327
00:33:52,919 --> 00:34:05,150
root of one minus x^2.
And then, that becomes, well, the root of

328
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:12,909
one minus x^2
minus x^2 root of one minus x^2 minus y minus

329
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,269
x^2 to the three
halves over three. And actually,

330
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,129
if you look at it for long enough, see, this
says one minus

331
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,569
x^2 times square root of one minus x^2.
So, actually, that's also,

332
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:33,179
so, in fact, that simplifies to two thirds
of one minus x^2 to the three halves.

333
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:53,589
OK, let me redo that, maybe, slightly differently.
This was one minus x^2 times y. So -- -- 
one minus x^2 times y

334
00:34:53,589 --> 00:35:02,380
becomes square root of one minus x^2 minus
y^3 over three.

335
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,469
And then, when I take y equals zero, I get
zero.

336
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,680
So, I don't subtract anything. OK, so now
you see this is one

337
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,999
minus x^2 to the three halves minus a third
of it.

338
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:21,079
So, you're left with two thirds. OK, so, that's
the integral.

339
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,239
The outer integral is the integral from zero
to one of two

340
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:32,099
thirds of one minus x^2 to the three halves
dx.

341
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:41,089
And, well,
I let you see if you remember single variable

342
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:44,190
integrals by
trying to figure out what this actually comes

343
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:51,670
out to be is it
pi over two, or pi over eight, actually?

344
00:35:51,670 --> 00:36:09,779
I think it's pi over eight. OK, well I guess
we have to do

345
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:16,440
it then. I wrote something on my notes,
but it's not very clear, OK?

346
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,450
So, how do we compute this thing?
Well, we have to do trig substitution.

347
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,180
That's the only way I know to compute an integral
like that,

348
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:33,200
OK? So, we'll set x equal sine
theta, and then square root of one minus x^2

349
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,039
will be cosine
theta. We are using sine squared plus

350
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:46,660
cosine squared equals one. And, so that will
become -- --

351
00:36:46,660 --> 00:37:02,369
so, two thirds remains two thirds.
One minus x^2 to the three halves becomes

352
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:09,450
cosine cubed
theta. dx, well, if x is sine theta,

353
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:16,869
then dx is cosine theta d theta.
So, that's cosine theta d theta. And,

354
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,650
well, if you do things with substitution,
which is the way I do them, then you should

355
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,450
worry about the
bounds for theta which will be zero to pi

356
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,319
over two.
Or, you can also just plug in the bounds at

357
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:34,559
the end.
So, now you have the two thirds times the

358
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,039
integral from zero to
pi over two of cosine to the fourth theta

359
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,589
d theta.
And, how do you integrate that? Well, you

360
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:54,430
have to use double
angle formulas. OK, so cosine to the fourth,

361
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:02,779
remember, cosine squared theta is one plus
cosine two theta

362
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:18,859
over two. And, we want the square of that.
And, so that will give us -- -- of,

363
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:29,339
well, we'll have, it's actually one quarter
plus

364
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,319
one half cosine to theta plus one quarter
cosine square to

365
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:42,359
theta d theta. And, how will you handle this
guy? Well, using,

366
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,599
again, the double angle formula.
OK, so it's getting slightly nasty.

367
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,769
So, but I don't know any simpler solution
except for one

368
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,799
simpler solution, which is you have a table
of

369
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:08,519
integrals of this form inside the notes.
Yes? No, I don't think so because if

370
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,759
you take one half times cosine half times
two,

371
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:18,539
you will still have half, OK?
So, if you do, again, the double angle

372
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,269
formula, I think I'm not going to bother to
do it.

373
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:28,130
I claim you will get, at the end, pi over
eight

374
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:51,079
because I say so. OK, so exercise,
continue calculating and get pi over eight.

375
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,930
OK, now what does the show us? Well, this
shows us,

376
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,359
actually, that this is probably not the right
way to do this.

377
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,119
OK, the right way to do this will be to integrate
it in polar

378
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:09,450
coordinates. And, that's what we will learn
how to do tomorrow. So, we will actually see

379
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:24,049
how to
do it with much less trig.

380
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:49,559
So, that will be easier in polar coordinates.
So, we will see that tomorrow. OK, so we are

381
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,529
almost there.
I mean, here you just use a double angle again

382
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,019
and then you
can get it. And, it's pretty

383
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,569
straightforward. OK, so one thing that's kind
of

384
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:04,009
interesting to know is we can exchange the
order of

385
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:13,180
integration. Say we have an integral given
to us in the order dy dx, we can switch it

386
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,759
to dx dy.
But, we have to be extremely careful with

387
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:21,940
the bounds.
So, you certainly cannot just swap the bounds

388
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,959
of the inner and
outer because there you would end up having

389
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:29,130
this square root
of one minus x^2 on the outside, and you would

390
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,459
never get a
number out of that. So, that cannot work.

391
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:41,170
It's more complicated than that. OK, so, well,
here's a first baby example. Certainly, if

392
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,579
I do integral
from zero to one, integral from zero to two

393
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:51,400
dx
dy, there, I can certainly switch the bounds

394
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,140
without
thinking too much. What's the reason for that?

395
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,619
Well, the reason for that is this corresponds
in both cases

396
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,950
to integrating x from zero to two, and y from
zero to one.

397
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:11,079
It's a rectangle. So, if I slice it this way,
you see that y goes from zero to one for any

398
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:13,869
x between zero
and two. It's this guy.

399
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:20,160
If I slice it that way, then x goes from zero
to two

400
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,650
for any value of y between zero and one.
And, it's this one. So, here it works.

401
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,440
But in general, I have to draw picture of
my

402
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,660
region, and see how the slices look like both
ways.

403
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:44,259
OK, so let's do a more interesting one.
Let's say that I want to compute an integral

404
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:49,700
from zero to
one of integral from x to square root of x

405
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:57,900
of e^y over y dy dx.
So, why did I choose this guy? Which is the

406
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,950
guy because as far
as I can tell, there's no way to integrate

407
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,239
e^y
over y. So, this is an integral that

408
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,859
you cannot compute this way. So, it's a good
example for why

409
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,890
this can be useful. So, if you do it this
way,

410
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,979
you are stuck immediately. So, instead,
we will try to switch the order.

411
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:23,969
But, to switch the order, we have to understand,
what do these bounds mean? OK, so let's draw

412
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:29,829
a picture of
the region. Well what I am saying is y

413
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:39,279
equals x to y equals square root of x.
Well, let's draw y equals x, and y equals

414
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:51,160
square root of x.
Well, maybe I should actually put this here,

415
00:43:51,160 --> 00:44:01,380
y equals x to y equals square root of x.
OK, and so I will go, for each value of x

416
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,569
I will go
from y equals xo to y equals square root of

417
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:08,910
x.
And then, we'll do that for values of x that

418
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,799
go from x
equals zero to x equals one, which happens

419
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:19,630
to be exactly
where these things intersect. So, my region

420
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:25,849
will consist of
all this, OK? So now, if I want to do it the

421
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:33,209
other way around, I have to decompose my region.
The other way around, I have to, so my goal,

422
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:36,549
now, is to rewrite this as an integral.
Well, it's still the same function.

423
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:40,950
It's still e to the y over y. But now, I want
to integrate dx

424
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:49,450
dy. So, how do I integrate over x?
Well, I fix a value of y. And, for that value

425
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,650
of y,
what's the range of x? Well, the range for

426
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,479
x is from
here to here. OK, what's the value of x here?

427
00:44:57,479 --> 00:45:02,559
Let's start with an easy one. This is x equals
y.

428
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:14,950
What about this one? It's x equals y^2.
OK, so, x goes from y2 to y, and then what

429
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,719
about y?
Well, I have to start at the bottom of my

430
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,529
region.
That's y equals zero to the top, which is

431
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:30,569
at y equals one.
So, y goes from zero to one. So, switching

432
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:34,229
the bounds is not
completely obvious. That took a little bit

433
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:39,299
of work.
But now that we've done that, well,

434
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:42,769
just to see how it goes, it's actually going
to be much

435
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:50,640
easier to integrate because the inner integral,
well, what's the integral of e^y over y with

436
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:59,109
respect to x?
It's just that times x, right, from x equals

437
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:03,579
y^2 to y.
So, that will be, well, if I plug x equals

438
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:08,759
y,
I will get e to the y minus, if I plug x equals

439
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:13,719
y^2,
I will get e to the y over y times y^2 into

440
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:18,630
the y times y,
OK? So, now, if I do the outer

441
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:25,829
integral, I will have the integral from zero
to one of e

442
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:32,569
to the y minus y^e to the y dy. And, that
one actually is a

443
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:39,049
little bit easier. So, we know how to integrate
e^y. We don't quite know how to

444
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:46,459
integrate ye^y. But, let's try.
So, let's see, what's the derivative of ye^y?

445
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:55,920
Well, there's a product rule that's one times
e^y plus y

446
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:03,239
times the derivative of e^y is ye^y.
So, if we do, OK, let's put a minus sign in

447
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:07,380
front. Well, that's almost what we
want, except we have a minus e^y instead of

448
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:14,130
a plus e^y.
So, we need to add 2e^y. And, I claim that's

449
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,690
the
antiderivative. OK, if you got lost,

450
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,989
you can also integrate by integrating by parts,
by taking the derivative of y and integrating

451
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:28,349
these guys.
Or, but, you know, that works. Just, your

452
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:32,029
first guess would
be, maybe, let's try minus y^e to the y.

453
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:34,249
Take the derivative of that, compare, see
what you need to

454
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:39,719
do to fix. And so, if you take that
between zero and one, you'll actually get

455
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,549
e minus
two. OK,

456
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:53,369
so, tomorrow we are going to see
how to do double integrals in polar coordinates,

457
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:57,559
and also applications of double integrals,
how to use them for interesting things.
