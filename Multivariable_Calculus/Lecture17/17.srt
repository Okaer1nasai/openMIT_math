00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
Yesterday we saw how to define double integrals
and how to

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:38,520
start computing them in terms of x and y coordinates.
We have defined the double integral over a

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,810
region R and
plane of a function f of x, y dA.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:54,610
You cannot hear me? Is the sound working?
Can you hear me in the back now? Can we make

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,180
the sound louder?
Does this work? People are not hearing me

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,600
in
the back. Is it better?

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,159
People are still saying make it louder.
Is it better? OK.

13
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,539
Great. Thanks.
That's not a reason to start chatting with

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,780
your friends.
Thanks. When we have a region in the x,

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:34,299
y plane and we have a function of x and y,
we are defining the double integral of f over

16
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:40,340
this region
by taking basically the sum of the values

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,450
of a function
everywhere in here times the area element.

18
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,369
And the definition, actually, is we split
the region into

19
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,939
lots of tiny little pieces, we multiply the
value of a

20
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,770
function at the point times the area of a
little piece and we

21
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:05,009
sum that everywhere. And we have seen,
actually, how to compute these things as iterated

22
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,110
integrals.
First, integrating over dy and then over dx,

23
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:19,450
or the other way around. One example that
we did,

24
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:29,810
in particular, was to compute the double
integral of a quarter of a unit disk.

25
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,380
That was the region where x squared plus y
squared is less

26
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,990
than one and x and y are positive, of one
minus x squared

27
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,770
minus y squared dA. Well, hopefully,
I kind of convinced you that we can do it

28
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,970
using enough trig and
substitutions and so on, but it is not very

29
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,040
pleasant.
And the reason for that is that using x and

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,980
y coordinates here
does not seem very appropriate. In fact, we

31
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,340
can use polar
coordinates instead to compute this double

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:20,240
integral.
Remember that polar coordinates are about

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,370
replacing x and y as
coordinates for a point on a plane by instead

34
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,760
r,
which is the distance from the origin to a

35
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,180
point,
and theta, which is the angle measured

36
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:44,460
counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
In terms of r and theta, you have x equals

37
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:53,600
r cosine
theta, y equals r sine theta. The claim is

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,790
we are able,
actually, to do double integrals in polar

39
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,150
coordinates.
We just have to learn how to. Just to draw

40
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:11,770
a quick picture --
When we were integrating in x, y coordinates,

41
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,810
in rectangular coordinates, we were slicing
our region by

42
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,600
gridlines that were either horizontal or vertical.
And we used that to set up the iterated integral.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,880
And we said dA became dx dy or dy dx.
Now we are going to actually integrate, in

44
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,400
terms of the polar
coordinates, r and theta. Let's say we will

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,760
integrate in
the order with r first and then theta.

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,380
That is the order that makes the most sense
usually when you

47
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:57,630
do polar coordinates. What does that mean?
It means that we will first focus on a slice

48
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,520
where we fix
the value of theta and we will let r vary.

49
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,900
That means we fix a direction, we fix a ray
out from the

50
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,910
origin in a certain direction. And we will
travel along this

51
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,100
ray and see which part of it, which values
of r are in our

52
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:24,000
region. Here it will be actually pretty
easy because r will just start at zero, and

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,540
you will have to
stop when you exit this quarter disk.

54
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,990
Well, what is the equation of this circle
in polar

55
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:38,130
coordinates? It is just r equals one.
So, we will stop when r reaches one.

56
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,919
But what about theta? Well, the first ray
that we

57
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,250
might want to consider is the one that goes
along the x-axis.

58
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,340
That is when theta equals zero. And we will
stop when theta

59
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
reaches pi over two because we don't care
about the rest of the

60
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:03,750
disk. We only care about the first
quadrant. We will stop at pi over two.

61
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:11,199
Now, there is a catch, though, which is that
dA is not

62
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,030
dr d theta. Let me explain to you why.
Let's say that we are slicing. What it means

63
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,280
is we are cutting
our region into little pieces that are the

64
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,280
elementary,
you know, what corresponds to a small

65
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,810
rectangle in the x, y coordinate system,
here would be actually a little piece of circle

66
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:41,110
between a given
radius r and r plus delta r. And given between

67
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,660
an angle
theta and theta plus delta theta.

68
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,370
I need to draw, actually, a bigger picture
of

69
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:56,090
that because it makes it really hard to read.
Let's say that I fix an angle theta and a

70
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:02,340
slightly different
one where I have added delta theta to it.

71
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:11,770
And let's say that I have a radius r and I
add delta r to

72
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:19,370
it. Then I will have a little piece
of x, y plane that is in here. And I have

73
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,620
to figure out what
is its area? What is delta A for this guy?

74
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,330
Well, let's see. This guy actually,
you know, if my delta r and delta theta are

75
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,949
small enough,
it will almost look like a rectangle.

76
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,669
It is rotated, but it is basically a
rectangle. I mean these sides,

77
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,270
of course, are curvy, but they are short enough
and

78
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,770
it is almost straight. The area here should
be this

79
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,759
length times that length. Well, what is this
length?

80
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:02,830
That one is easy. It is delta r.
What about that length? Well, it is not delta

81
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,449
theta.
It is something slightly different.

82
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,970
It is a piece of a circle of radius r corresponding
to angle

83
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:25,570
delta theta, so it is r delta theta.
So, times r delta theta. That means now,

84
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,000
even if we shrink things and take smaller
and smaller

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,599
regions, dA is going to be r dr d theta.
That is an important thing to remember.

86
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,580
When you integrate in polar coordinates, you
just set up

87
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,330
your bounds in terms of r and theta, but you
replace dA by r

88
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,710
dr d theta, not just dr d theta. And then,
of course,

89
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:02,240
we have some function that we are integrating.
Let's say that I call that thing f then it

90
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,820
is the same f
that I put up here. Concretely, how do I do

91
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,380
it here?
Well, my function f was given as one minus

92
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,250
x squared minus y
squared. And I would like to switch that

93
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,990
to polar coordinates. I want to put r and
theta in

94
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,600
there. Well, I have formulas for x and
y in polar coordinates so I could just replace

95
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,290
x squared by
r squared cosine squared theta, y squared

96
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,490
by r squared sine
squared theta. And that works just fine.

97
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,830
But maybe you can observe that this is x squared
plus y

98
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,040
squared. It is just the square of a
distance from the origin, so that is just

99
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,580
r squared.
That is a useful thing. You don't strictly

100
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,560
need it,
but it is much faster if you see this right

101
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:07,540
away.
It saves you writing down a sine and a cosine.

102
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,070
Now we just end up with the integral from
zero to pi over

103
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:19,440
two, integral from zero to one of one minus
r squared r dr d

104
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:30,250
theta. Now, if I want to compute this
integral, so let's first do the inner integral.

105
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,950
If I integrate r minus r cubed, I will get
r squared over two

106
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,040
minus r squared over four between zero and
one.

107
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:50,560
And then I will integrate d theta.
What is this equal to? Well, for r equals

108
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,930
one you get
one-half minus one-quarter, which is going

109
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,040
to be just
one-quarter. And when you plug in zero you

110
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,060
get zero. So, it is the integral from
zero to pi over two of one-quarter d theta.

111
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,770
And that just integrates to one-quarter times
pi over two,

112
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:16,950
which is pi over eight. That is a lot easier
than the

113
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:23,089
way we did it yesterday. Well, here we were
lucky.

114
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,399
I mean usually you will switch to polar coordinates
either

115
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,350
because the region is easier to set up.
Here it is indeed easier to set up because

116
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,910
the bounds became
very simple. We don't have that square root

117
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,029
of one minus x squared anymore. Or because
the integrant

118
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,930
becomes much simpler. Here our function,
well, it is not very complicated in x,

119
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,980
y coordinates, but it is even simpler in r
theta coordinates. Here we were very lucky.

120
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,220
In general, there is maybe a trade off.
Maybe it will be easier to set up bounds but

121
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,620
maybe the function
will become harder because it will have all

122
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,240
these sines and
cosines in it. If our function had been just

123
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,930
x, x is very easy in x, y coordinates.
Here it becomes r cosine theta. That means

124
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,000
you will have a
little bit of trig to do in the integral.

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,360
Not a very big one, not a very complicated
integral, but imagine it could get potentially

126
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,149
much harder.
Anyway, that is double integrals in polar

127
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:30,910
coordinates.
And the way you set up the bounds in general,

128
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,080
well, in 99% of the cases you will integrate
over r first.

129
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,640
What you will do is you will look for a given
theta what are

130
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,010
the bounds of r to be in the region.
What is the portion of my ray that is in the

131
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,170
given region?
And then you will put bounds for theta.

132
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,269
But conceptually it is the same as before.
Instead of slicing horizontally or vertically,

133
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,649
we slice radially. We will do more examples
in a

134
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:16,910
bit. Any questions about this or the
general method? Yes?

135
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:26,600
That is a very good question. Why do I measure
the length

136
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,269
inside instead of outside? Which one do I
want?

137
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,060
This one. Here I said this side is r
delta theta. I could have said,

138
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,950
actually, r delta theta is the length here.
Here it is slightly more, r plus delta r times

139
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,800
delta
theta. But, if delta r is very small

140
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,690
compared to r, then that is almost the same
thing. And this is an approximation

141
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:54,980
anyway. I took this one because it
gives me the simpler formula. If you take

142
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,800
the limit as delta
r turns to zero then the two things become

143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,000
the same anyway.
The length, whether you put r or r plus delta

144
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,209
r in here,
doesn't matter anymore. If you imagine that

145
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,390
this guy is
infinitely small then, really, the lengths

146
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,610
become the
same. We will also see another proof

147
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:23,040
of this formula, using changes of variables,
next week. But, I mean,

148
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:33,350
hopefully this is at least slightly convincing.
More questions? No.

149
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:42,300
OK. Let's see.
We have seen how to compute double integrals.

150
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,800
I have to tell you what they are good for
as well.

151
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,470
The definition we saw yesterday and the motivation
was in terms

152
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,350
of finding volumes, but that is not going
to be our

153
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,860
main preoccupation. Because finding volumes
is fun

154
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,920
but that is not all there is to life.
I mean, you are doing single integrals.

155
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,420
When you do single integrals it is usually
not to find the area

156
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,920
of some region of a plane. It is for something
else

157
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,130
usually. The way we actually think of
the double integral is really as summing the

158
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,529
values of a function
all around this region. We can use that to

159
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,149
get
information about maybe the region or about

160
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,779
the average
value of a function in that region and so

161
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:39,250
on.
Let's think about various uses of double integrals.

162
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,459
The first one that I will mention is actually
something

163
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,970
you thought maybe you could do with a single
integral,

164
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,870
but it is useful very often to do it as a
double integral.

165
00:15:50,870 --> 00:16:03,810
It is to find the area of a given region r.
I give you some region in the plane and you

166
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,240
want to know just
its area. In various cases,

167
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,139
you could set this up as a single integral,
but often it could be useful to set it up

168
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,510
as a double integral.
How do you express the area as a double integral?

169
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,410
Well, the area of this region is the sum of
the areas of all

170
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,959
the little pieces. It means you want to sum
one dA

171
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:46,470
of the entire region. The area R is the double
integral over R of a function one.

172
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,130
One way to think about it, if you are really
still

173
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,370
attached to the idea of double integral as
a volume,

174
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,100
what this measures is the volume below the
graph of a

175
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,750
function one. The graph of a function one
is

176
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,850
just a horizontal plane at height one.
What you would be measuring is the volume

177
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:11,520
of a prism with base
r and height one. And the volume of that would

178
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,270
be, of course, base times height.
It would just be the area of r again.

179
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,480
But we don't actually need to think about
it that way.

180
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,709
Really, what we are doing is summing dA over
the entire

181
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:33,460
region. A related thing we can do,
imagine that, actually, this is some physical

182
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,790
object. I mean, it has to be a flat
object because we are just dealing with things

183
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,429
in the plane
so far. But you have a flat metal plate

184
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,100
or something and you would like to know its
mass.

185
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,280
Well, its mass is the sum of the masses of
every single

186
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,370
little piece. You would get that by
integrating the density. The density for a

187
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:02,429
flat object
would be the mass per unit area. So, you can

188
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:18,250
get the mass of a
flat object with density. Let's use delta

189
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:30,690
for density,
which is the mass per unit area.

190
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,530
Each little piece of your object will have
a mass,

191
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,419
which will be just the density, times its
area for each small

192
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:50,270
piece. And you will get the total mass
by summing these things. The mass will be

193
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,850
the double
integral of the density times the area element.

194
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,650
Now, if it has constant density,
if it is always the same material then,

195
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,910
of course, you could just take the density
out and you will get density times the total

196
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,120
area if you know
that it is always the same material.

197
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,720
But if, actually, it has varying density maybe
because it is some metallic thing with various

198
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,970
metals or
with varying thickness or something then you

199
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,370
can still get
the mass by integrating the density.

200
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,350
Of course, looking at flat objects might be
a little bit

201
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,299
strange. That is because we are only
doing double integrals so far. In a few weeks,

202
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,690
we will be triple integrals. And then we will
be able to do

203
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:59,320
solids in space, but one thing at 
a time.
Another useful application is to find the

204
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:14,809
average value of
some quantity in a region. What does it mean

205
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,260
to take the
average value of some function f in this region

206
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,830
r?
Well, you know what the average of a finite

207
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,380
set of data is.
For example, if I asked you to compute your

208
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,360
average score on 18.02 problem sets,
you would just take the scores, add them and

209
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,460
divide by the
number of problem sets. What if there are

210
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,110
infinitely
many things? Say I ask you to find the

211
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,610
average temperature in this room.
Well, you would have to measure the temperature

212
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,350
everywhere.
And then add all of these together and divide

213
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,490
by the
number of data points. But, depending on how

214
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,830
careful
you are, actually, there are potentially

215
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,320
infinitely many points to look at.
The mathematical way to define the average

216
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,799
of a continuous set
of data is that you actually integrate the

217
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,539
function over the
entire set of data, and then you divide by

218
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:05,100
the size
of the sample, which is just the area of the

219
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:16,049
region. In fact, the average of f,
the notation we will use usually for that

220
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:23,070
is f with a bar
on top to tell us it is the average f.

221
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:30,250
We say we will take the integral of f and
we will divide

222
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:36,990
by the area of the region. You can really
think of it as

223
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,690
the sum of the values of f everywhere divided
by the number

224
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:48,850
of points everywhere. And so that is an average
where

225
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,280
everything is, actually, equally likely.
That is a uniform average where all the points

226
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,390
on the region,
all the little points of the region are equally

227
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,559
likely.
But maybe if want to do, say, an average of

228
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,770
some solid
with variable density or if you want to somehow

229
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,110
give more
importance to certain parts than to others

230
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,980
then you can actually
do a weighted average. What is a weighted

231
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:21,010
average?
Well, in the case of taking the

232
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,650
average your problem sets, if I tell you problem
set one

233
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,410
is worth twice as much as the others,
then you would count twice that score in the

234
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,160
sum and then you
would count it as two, of course, when you

235
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,260
divide.
The weighted average is the sum of the values,

236
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,250
but each weighted by a certain coefficient.
And then you will divide by the sum of the

237
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,500
weight.
It is a bit the same idea as when we replace

238
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,500
area by some
mass that tells you how important a given

239
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:58,500
piece.
We will actually have a density. Let's call

240
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,030
it delta again.
We will see what we divide by, but what we

241
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,059
will take is the
integral of a function times the density times

242
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,100
the area element.
Because this would correspond to the mass

243
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:22,360
element telling us
how to weight the various points of our region.

244
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,130
And then we would divide by the total weight,
which is the mass of a region, as defined

245
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:36,480
up there.
If a density is uniform then, of course, the

246
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,400
density gets out
and you can simplify and reduce to that if

247
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,650
all the points are
equally likely. Why is that important?

248
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:54,130
Well, that is important for various applications.
But one that you might have seen in physics,

249
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,520
we care about maybe where is the center of
mass of a given

250
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,580
object? The center of mass is basically
a point that you would say is right in the

251
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,030
middle of the
object. But, of course,

252
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,950
if the object has a very strange shape or
if somehow part

253
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,409
of it is heavier than the rest then that takes
a very different

254
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,270
meaning. Strictly speaking,
the center of mass of a solid is the point

255
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,140
where you would
have to concentrate all the mass if you wanted

256
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,090
it to behave
equivalently from a point of view of mechanics,

257
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,320
if you are trying to do translations of that
object.

258
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,030
If you are going to push that object that
would be really

259
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:44,559
where the equivalent point mass would lie.
The other way to think about it,

260
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,970
if I had a flat object then the center of
mass would basically

261
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,559
be the point where I would need to hold it
so it is perfectly

262
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,559
balanced. And, of course,
I cannot do this. Well, you get the idea.

263
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,270
And the center of mass of this eraser is somewhere
in the

264
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,169
middle. And so, in principle,
that is where I would have to put my finger

265
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:10,400
for it to stay.
Well, it doesn't work. But that is where the

266
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,450
center of
mass should be. I think it should be in the

267
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:23,990
middle. Maybe I shouldn't call this
three. I should call this 2a,

268
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:31,450
because it is really a special case of the
average value.

269
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:43,850
How do we find the center of mass of a flat
object with

270
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:54,960
density delta. If you have your object in
the

271
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:03,289
x, y plane then its center of mass
will be at positions that are actually just

272
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:07,330
the coordinates of
a center of mass, will just be weighted averages

273
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,730
of x and y on the solid. So, the center of
mass will be

274
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:19,270
a position that I will call x bar, y bar.
And these are really just the averages, the

275
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,280
average values of
x and of y in the solid. Just to give you

276
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,640
the formulas
again, x bar would be one over the mass times

277
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,400
the double
integral of x times density dA. And the same

278
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:50,820
thing with y.
y bar is the weighted average of a y coordinate

279
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,980
in your
region. You see, if you take a region

280
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,340
that is symmetric and has uniform density
that will just

281
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,179
give you the center of the region.
But if the region has a strange shape or if

282
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,299
a density is not
homogeneous, if parts of it are heavier then

283
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,669
you will get whatever the weighted average
will be.

284
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:15,200
And that will be the point where this thing
would be

285
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,230
balanced if you were trying to balance it
on a pole or on your

286
00:27:19,230 --> 00:28:13,000
finger.
Any questions 

287
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,929
so far? Yes.
No. Here I didn't set this up as a

288
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:22,549
iterated integral yet. The function that I
am

289
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,789
integrating is x times delta where density
will be given to

290
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,860
me maybe as a function of x and y.
And then I will integrate this dA.

291
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,950
And dA could mean dx over dy, it could mean
dy over dx,

292
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,549
it could be mean r dr d theta. I will choose
how to set it up

293
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:46,039
depending maybe on the shape of the region.
If my solid is actually just going to be round

294
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,179
then I might
want to use polar coordinates. If it is a

295
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,710
square,
I might want to use x, y coordinates.

296
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,480
If it is more complicated, well, I will choose
depending

297
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:05,049
on how I feel about it. Yes?
Delta is the density. In general, it is a

298
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,450
function of
x and y. If you imagine that your solid

299
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,289
is not homogenous then its density will depend
on which

300
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:14,220
piece of it you are looking at. Of course,
to compute this,

301
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,990
you need to know the density. If you have
a problem asking

302
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,419
you to find the center of mass of something
and you have no

303
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,429
information about the density, assume it is
uniform.

304
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:28,840
Take the density to be a constant.
Even take it to be a one. That is even easier.

305
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,820
I mean it is a general fact of math.
We don't care about units. If density is constant,

306
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,980
we might as well take it to be one.
That just means our mass unit becomes the

307
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:53,090
area unit.
Yes? That is a good question.

308
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,250
No, I don't think we could actually find the
center of mass

309
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,490
in polar coordinates by finding the average
of R or the average

310
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:06,279
of theta. For example,
take a disk center at the origin, well,

311
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,640
the center of mass should be at the origin.
But the average of R is certainly not zero

312
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,820
because R is
positive everywhere. So, that doesn't work.

313
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,309
You cannot get the polar coordinates of a
center of mass

314
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,210
just by taking the average of R and the average
of theta.

315
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,929
By the way, what is the average of theta?
If you take theta to from zero to 2pi, the

316
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,710
average theta will
be pi. If you take it to go from minus

317
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,210
pi to pi, the average theta will be zero.
So, there is a problem there. That actually

318
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,460
just doesn't
work, so we really have to compute x bar and

319
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,590
y bar.
But still we could set this up and then switch

320
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,870
to polar
coordinates to evaluate this integral.

321
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:50,690
But we still would be computing the average
values of x and y.

322
00:30:50,690 --> 00:31:03,270
We are basically re-exploring mechanics and
motion of solids

323
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:14,850
here. The next thing is moment of
inertia. Just to remind you or in case

324
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:22,440
you somehow haven't seen it in physics yet,
the moment of inertia is basically to rotation

325
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,770
of a solid
where the mass is to translation.

326
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,299
In the following sense, the mass of a solid
is what

327
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,760
makes it hard to push it. How hard it is to
throw

328
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,990
something is related to its mass.
How hard it is to spin something, on the other

329
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,549
hand,
is given by its moment of inertia.

330
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:53,659
Maybe I should write this down. Mass is how
hard it is to

331
00:31:53,659 --> 00:32:05,179
impart a translation motion to a solid.
I am using fancy words today. And the moment

332
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:11,610
of inertia --
The difference with a mass is that the moment

333
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:17,149
of inertia is
defined about some axis. You choose an axis.

334
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:19,470
Then you would try to measure how hard it
is to spin your

335
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,659
object around that axis. For example,
you can try to measure how hard it is to spin

336
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:26,909
this sheet of
paper about an axis that is in the center

337
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,330
of it.
We would try to spin it light that and see

338
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,510
how much effort I
would have to make. Well, for a sheet of paper

339
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,710
not
very much. That would measure the same

340
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:58,529
thing but it would be rotation motion about
that axis.

341
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:01,580
Maybe some of you know the definition but
I am going to try

342
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,679
to derive it again. I am sorry but it won't
be as

343
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,850
quite as detailed as the way you have probably
seen it in

344
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,159
physics, but I am not trying to replace your
physics teachers.

345
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:18,120
I am sure they are doing a great job.
What is the idea for the definition to find

346
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,260
a formula for
moment of inertia? The idea is to think about

347
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:27,870
kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is really when
you push something or when you try to make

348
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,590
it move and you have
to put some inertia to it. Then it has kinetic

349
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,360
energy.
And then, if you have the right device, you

350
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,620
can convert back
that kinetic energy into something else.

351
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,740
If you try to look at the kinetic energy of
a point mass,

352
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,710
so you have something with mass m going at
the velocity v,

353
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,909
well, that will be one-half of a mass times
the square of the

354
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:03,039
speed. I hope you have all seen that
formula some time before. Now, let's say instead

355
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,220
of just
trying to push this mass, I am going to make

356
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:13,299
it spin
around something. Instead of just somewhere,

357
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:19,159
maybe I will have the origin, and I am trying
to make it go

358
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,619
around the origin in a circle at a certain
angular velocity.

359
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:40,259
For a mass m at distance r, let's call r this
distance.

360
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:48,279
And angular velocity, let's call the angular
velocity

361
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:52,229
omega. I think that is what physicists
call it. Remember angular velocity is

362
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:56,469
just the rate of the change of the angle over
time.

363
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:02,209
It is d theta dt, if you want. Well, what
is the kinetic

364
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:06,880
energy now? Well, first we have to find out
what the speed is. What is the speed?

365
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,769
Well, if we are going on a circle of
radius r at angular velocity omega that means

366
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:16,950
that in unit
time we rotate by omega and we go by a distance

367
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:24,989
of r times
omega. The actual speed is the radius

368
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:31,029
times angular velocity. And so the kinetic
energy is

369
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:37,150
one-half mv squared, which is one-half m r
squared

370
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:46,769
omega squared. And so,
by similarity with that formula,

371
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:52,759
the coefficient of v squared is the mass,
and here we will say the coefficient of omega

372
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:55,749
squared,
so this thing is the moment of inertia.

373
00:35:55,749 --> 00:36:20,019
That is how we define moment of inertia.
Now, that is only for a point mass.

374
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,799
And it is kind of fun to spin just a small
bowl,

375
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:27,319
but maybe you would like to spin actually
a larger solid and

376
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,269
try to define this moment of inertia.
Well, the moment inertia of a solid will be

377
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:36,640
just the sum of
the moments of inertia of all the little pieces.

378
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,690
What we will do is just cut our solid into
little chunks and

379
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:58,190
will sum this thing for each little piece.
For a solid with density delta, each little

380
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:07,180
piece has mass
which is the density times the amount of area.

381
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:12,729
This is equal actually. And the moment of
inertia of

382
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:16,200
that small portion of a solid will be delta
m,

383
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,599
the small mass, times r squared,
the square of a distance to the center of

384
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:27,609
the axis along which I
am spinning. That means if I sum these

385
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:41,279
things together, well, it has moment of inertia
delta m times r squared, which is r squared

386
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:46,509
times the
density times delta A. And so I will be summing

387
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:52,400
these
things together. And so, the moment of inertia

388
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,299
about the origin will be the double integral
of r squared

389
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:34,459
times density times dA.
The final formula for the moment of inertia

390
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:42,789
about the
origin is the double integral of a region

391
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:49,049
of r squared density
dA. If you are going to do it in x,

392
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:51,410
y coordinates, of course, r squared becomes
x

393
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,369
squared plus y squared, it is the square of
the

394
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:01,769
distance from the origin. When you integrate
this,

395
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:05,099
that tells you how hard it is to spin that
solid about the

396
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,819
origin. The motion that we try to do --
We keep this fixed and then we just rotate

397
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:19,619
around the origin.
Sorry. That is a pretty bad picture,

398
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:29,069
but hopefully you know what I mean.
And the name we use for that is I0.

399
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:43,880
And then the rotational kinetic energy 
is one-half times this
moment of inertia times the square of the

400
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,319
angular velocity.
So that shows as that this replaces the mass

401
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:57,700
for rotation
motions. OK.

402
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:04,789
What about other kinds of rotations?
In particular, we have been rotating things

403
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:10,219
about just a point in the plane. What you
could imagine also is

404
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:18,709
instead you have your solid. What I have done
so far is I

405
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,920
have skewered it this way, and I am rotating
around the

406
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,900
axis. Instead, I could skewer it
through, say, the horizontal axis.

407
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,739
And then I could try to spin about the horizontal
axis so

408
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:46,259
then it would rotate in space in that direction
like that.

409
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:53,199
Let's say we do rotation about the x-axis.
Well, the idea would still be the same.

410
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,430
The moment of inertia for any small piece
of a solid would be

411
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,650
its mass element times the square of a distance
to the x

412
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,400
axes because that will be the radius of a
trajectory.

413
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,349
If you take this point here, it is going to
go in a circle

414
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:19,969
like that centered on the x-axis.
So the radius will just be this distance here.

415
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:31,019
Well, what is this distance? It is just y,
or maybe absolute value of y. Distance to

416
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:38,569
x-axis is absolute
value of y. What we actually care about is

417
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:44,239
the square of a distance, so it will just
be y squared.

418
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,229
The moment of inertia about the x-axis is
going to be obtained

419
00:41:49,229 --> 00:42:00,199
by integrating y squared times the mass element.
It is slightly strange but I have y in inertia

420
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,329
about the
x-axis. But, if you think about it,

421
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,229
y tells me how far I am from the x-axis, so
how hard it will

422
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:11,339
be to spin around the x-axis. And I could
do the same about

423
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,049
any axis that I want. Just I would have to
sum the

424
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:27,779
square of a distance to the axis of rotation.
Maybe I should do an example. Yes?

425
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:39,410
Same thing as above, distance to the x-axis,
because that is what we care about.

426
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,609
For the moment of inertia, we want the square
of a

427
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:56,119
distance to the axis of rotation.
Let's do an example. Let's try to figure out

428
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,809
if we
have just a uniform disk how hard it is to

429
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:07,529
spin it around its
center. That shouldn't be very hard to

430
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:29,869
figure out. Say that we have a disk of
radius a 
and we want to rotate it about its center.

431
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,789
And let's say that it is of uniform density.
And let's take just the density to be a one

432
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:40,019
so that we don't
really care about the density. What is the

433
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,769
moment of inertia
of that? Well, we have to integrate of

434
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:50,769
our disk r squared times the density, which
is one,

435
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:57,410
times dA. What is r squared?
You have here to resist the urge to say the

436
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,749
radius is just
a. We know the radius is a.

437
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:04,690
No, it is not a because we are looking at
rotation of any point

438
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,190
inside this disk. And, when you are inside
the

439
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,699
disk, the distance to the origin is not a.
It is less than a. It is actually anything

440
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,119
between
zero and a. Just to point out a pitfall,

441
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,920
r here is really a function on this disk.
And we are going to integrate this function.

442
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,609
Don't plug r equals a just yet. What coordinates
do we use to

443
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:32,420
compute this integral? They are probably polar
coordinates, unless you want a repeat of what

444
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,459
happened already
with x and y. That will tell us we want to

445
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:45,589
integrate r squared time r dr d theta.
And the bounds for r, well, r will go from

446
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,880
zero to a.
No matter which direction I go from the origin,

447
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,390
if I fixed it, r goes from zero to r equals
a.

448
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,989
The part of this ray that lives inside the
disk is always from

449
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:10,339
zero to a. And theta goes from,
well, zero to 2 pi for example. And now you

450
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:14,190
can compute this
integral. Well, I will let you figure it

451
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,099
out. But the inner integral becomes
a to the four over four and the outer multiplies

452
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:28,339
things by 2pi,
so you get pi a to the four over two.

453
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:37,569
OK. That is how hard it is to spin
this disk. Now, what about instead of

454
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:42,039
spinning it about the center we decided to
spin it about a point

455
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,029
on a second point. For example, think of a
Frisbee.

456
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:50,469
A Frisbee has this rim so you can actually
try to make it

457
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:54,719
rotate around the point on the circumference
by holding it near

458
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,709
the rim and spinning it there. How much harder
is that than

459
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:05,650
around the center? Well, we will try to compute
now the moment of inertia about this point.

460
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,319
We have two options. One is we keep the system
of

461
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,089
coordinates centers here. But then the formula
for

462
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:16,940
distance to this point becomes harder.
The other option, which is the one I will

463
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,499
choose,
is to change the coordinate so that this point

464
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:53,940
become the
origin. Let's do that.

465
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:10,640
About a point on the circumference,
what I would have to do maybe is set up my

466
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,779
region like that.
I have moved the origin so that it is on the

467
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:19,099
circumference of a
disk, and I will again try to find

468
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:27,469
the moment of inertia of this disk about the
origin.

469
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:33,859
It is still, for the the double integral of
r squared dA. But now I want to find out how

470
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:40,449
to set up the integral. I could try to use
x,

471
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:44,160
y coordinates and it would work.
Or I can use polar coordinates, and it works

472
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,359
a little bit
better that way. But both are doable.

473
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,589
Let's say I do it this way. I have to figure
out how to set

474
00:47:55,589 --> 00:48:05,499
up my bounds. What are the bounds for r?
Well, if I fix a value for theta, which means

475
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:10,390
I chose an
angle here, now I am shooting a ray from the

476
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:16,439
origin in that
direction. I enter my region at r equals

477
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:23,880
zero. That hasn't changed.
The question is where do I exit the region?

478
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,859
What is that distance? Maybe you have seen
it in

479
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:39,289
recitation, maybe not. Let's see.
Actually, I should have written down the radius

480
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:45,019
of a circle is
a. So this distance here is 2a.

481
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:50,539
If you draw this segment in here, you know
that here you

482
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:58,789
have a right angle. You have a right triangle.
The hypotenuse here has length 2a.

483
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:04,599
This angle is theta. Well, this length is
2a cosine

484
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:15,089
theta. The polar coordinates equation
of this circle passing through the origin

485
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:26,769
is r equals 2a cosine
theta. So, r will go from zero to 2a

486
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:35,799
cosine theta. That is the distance here.
Now, what are the bounds for theta?

487
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:42,140
It is not quite zero to 2pi because, actually,
you see in this direction, if I shoot a ray

488
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,819
in this
direction I will never meet my region.

489
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:49,739
We have to actually think a bit more.
Well, the directions in which I will actually

490
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:54,979
hit my circle are
all the directions in the right half of a

491
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:58,449
plane.
I mean, of course, if I shoot very close to

492
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:00,729
the
axis, you might think, oh, I won't be in there.

493
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:05,229
But, actually, that is not true because here
the circle is tangent to the axis.

494
00:50:05,229 --> 00:50:08,489
No matter which direction I take, I will still
have a little

495
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:15,699
tiny piece. The angle actually goes from
minus pi over two to pi over two.

496
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:24,589
If you compute that you will get,
well, the inner integral will be r to the

497
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:28,979
four over four
between zero and 2a cosine theta,

498
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:33,989
which will turn out to be 4a to the four cosine
to the four

499
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:43,999
theta. And now you will integrate that
for minus pi over two to pi over two.

500
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:50,759
And that is, again, the evil integral that
we had yesterday. Either we remember the method

501
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,779
from yesterday or we remember from yesterday
that actually

502
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:58,400
there are formulas in the notes to help you.
On homework, you can use these formulas.

503
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,789
In the notes at the beginning of section 3b
there are formulas

504
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:11,509
for these particular kinds of integrals.
And that will end up being three-halves of

505
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:14,670
pi a to the
four. In case you wanted to know,

506
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,749
it is three times harder to spin a Frisbee
about a point on

507
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:22,880
a circumference than around the center.
We got three times the moment of inertia about

508
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,130
the center.
OK. That is it.

509
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:27,669
Have a nice weekend.
